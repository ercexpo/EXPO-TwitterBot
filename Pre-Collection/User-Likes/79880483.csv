"🚨 First play of the day! (8/2) 🚨

Riley/Judge 1+ hit each (2u, -104)

There's risk with taking this before the MLB deadline, but at worst it gets voided.

Riley is .423 L7, 284 vs RHP, .305 vs Nelson's top pitches.

Judge is .370 L7, .310 vs RHP, .348 vs Gilbert's pitches.",1554488779586412546,girlsdoitbettor,1547646532077305860,79880483
