"Prob unpopular opinion but the Will Smith discourse got very dumb. The slap was stupid and immature yet he’s gotten more flack than actual Hollywood predators.

And had it been two of them attractive,  B list (white) actors everyone loves, it would’ve been spun very differently.",1553052634528899074,ScriptsByJames,570202211,119590064

"Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que sera, get a case of Syrah",1553035238716178432,Timmaaay_,321051813,119590064
