Truthfully I haven't looked into how much they actually censored besides knowing they did. I think the blood from the aliens was changed from red to green or something?,1554155738234224640,JSonic2021,1323713568735399938,1264994900
"Honestly... I wish Shadow the Hedgehog was released with it's original T rating, without all the censorship they made...
So the Sonic franchise could be recognized as not just a kids series.",1554155265448189964,JSonic2021,1323713568735399938,1264994900
