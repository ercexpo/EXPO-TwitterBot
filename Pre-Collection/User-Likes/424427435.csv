"I still believe a decent stint in Omaha could do Singer a lot of good. The lost minor league season hurt his development big time. He could’ve used at least half a year but when you’re options are Lopez and Sparkman, I get why #Royals tabbed him for a spot",1519134351308599297,RoyalReportKev,1133117275643555840,424427435
"The Royals have made accommodations and concessions for Adalberto Mondesi this year, and the returns have been demoralizing. @footenoted writes that it's no longer a matter of youth, inexperience or injury — Mondesi is who he is, and that's a problem. ⬇️

"Whit’s “consecutive game streak” thing is cute - but he’s already broken the team record and has no other record to break since he can’t catch Cal. 

Might be time to start getting a day off here and there to let the game slow down and clear his head.",1518383004384743425,royalsclubhouse,2412041858,424427435

No offense, but Friday Night Baseball is the A’s and Rangers. If MLB wants to showcase their young stars, here’s how to start.",1517678654804750336,prestonfarrSR,1059793669,424427435
