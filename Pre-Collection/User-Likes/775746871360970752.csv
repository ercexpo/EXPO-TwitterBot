A creep-o was in the park. I was hiding behind a tree for 5 minutes before I made my move, threw off my run! Doesn't happen at 3am.
Cool weather again, so nice. It was a delight to sleep in until 5, yes, I slept til 5am. 🤣

"Chasing multiple different training goals at once will give you a watered down response. 

Strength, hypertrophy and endurance all require a different stimulus. 

You can do it all if you choose. 

Just isn’t optimal. 

Better to split into specific phases.",1553342926452924416,CoachFHM,1099329259485782018,775746871360970752
