"Just waking up. Eric Hosmer has it written in his contract that he can‚Äôt be traded to the Nationals, said he won‚Äôt go, and now the fanbase is trying to bully him into it to get Juan Soto to San Diego? What a horrible situation he‚Äôs in.",1554518163433218050,molly_knight,45882011,1040057788032987136
"Anyone giving Eric Hosmer shit right now, ask yourself if you‚Äôd want to leave San Diego for friggin‚Äô DC. Take out the fact that the Padres just acquired the modern day Ted Williams and the Nats suck. You‚Äôre not leaving based on geographical location alone.",1554515197850681345,Jared_Carrabis,59345386,1040057788032987136
