@JakeLake720 True but honestly coming off a full ACL tear I think media and fans are less inclined to be critical of him not trying to play but part of it was probably his rep…lol people knew,1549081785761505283,Savy2Smooth,268113555,4901345657
@JakeLake720 Oh no you’re right and I kind of forget about that stuff happening I’m sure a lot of people do. Weren’t there rumors about his step dad making some decisions or something lol wild times,1549074400875610112,Savy2Smooth,268113555,4901345657
In hindsight I can’t even believe he did this shit lol…won with the spurs as a young player..got traded and immediately led Toronto to their first championship. There’s some luck involved but it’s still one of the most impressive individual seasons ever regardless of the stats https://t.co/2HreMIBGZR,1549070277677563906,Savy2Smooth,268113555,4901345657
@JakeLake720 That was a really good scene in the movie. So heartbreaking,1548822299582808064,Cubsfanatic76,47517449,4901345657
May have been the last time we see Robertson pitch for the Cubs. So glad he got the chance to get 1 more save before the break,1548783924029054976,Cubsfanatic76,47517449,4901345657
@JakeLake720 I’m just saying the overall idea of him dominating and winning a Cy Young without being an All Star. Plus pitchers across the board aren’t going as deep into games as they did even in 15.,1548746519930720256,chifanpatt2,1299362944023699458,4901345657
"In the 2000s, Peyton Manning won four MVPs to Tom Brady's one, played all 10 seasons to Brady's 8, and had higher passing efficiency in every season but one (2007). Brady, not Manning, was the First-Team All-Decade selection https://t.co/DUG7aVCFeE",1548713510661677060,KevinColePFF,2498265925,4901345657

"Mychal Givens took both losses in the Cubs vs Mets doubleheader, without giving up an earned run.

He is the first pitcher since 1913 (first season both leagues tracked earned runs) to lose multiple games on a single day without allowing an earned run.

@JakeLake720 Facts and don’t get me wrong steve smith was definitely next level and Mooney has to continue to put in work to get there but he can be that type of guy. Undersized but a true number 1 receiver,1548318446403719168,Savy2Smooth,268113555,4901345657
