@Bethel_Prescott @TheHorrorOf97 @mygenderisblack My endo still refuses to classify me as a type 1 diabetic in the system which means I'm likely to lose access to the medication and tools I need if they change what type 2s are qualified to get vs type 1s.,1554007636407984130,MermaidsLullaby,1147290447557079041,53056795
"@Bethel_Prescott @kaywaap @TheHorrorOf97 @mygenderisblack I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes based on the fact I am fat.

I actually have autoimmune diabetes and am insulin deficient and it could have cost me my life. I had to fight my endo for insulin for 6 months because they cared more about making me lose more weight.",1554007339417616384,MermaidsLullaby,1147290447557079041,53056795
