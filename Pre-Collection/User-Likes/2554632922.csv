My TLDL version of the 16-page report: Robinson agreed with the NFL on everything except for suspension length.,1554150506259329025,bylindsayhjones,250271653,2554632922
"Robinson wrote that the NFL met its burden to prove Watson violated the personal conduct policy in ""various ways,"" including that he ""engaged in sexual assault.""",1554149498204540928,bylindsayhjones,250271653,2554632922
"Judge Sue L. Robinson noted ""a lack of remorse"" as an aggravating factor in her disciplinary decision. She cited Watson's status as a first-time offender and his work in the community as a mitigating factor.",1554149020246757376,bylindsayhjones,250271653,2554632922
"Several notable lines from the 16-page report on Deshaun Watson:
- Although this is the most significant punishment ever imposed on an NFL player for allegations of 
non-violent sexual conduct, Mr. Watson’s pattern of conduct is more egregious than any before reviewed by the NFL",1554148690561904641,bylindsayhjones,250271653,2554632922
"Again, Robinson relies on the NFL to set its policy. She finds Watson's conduct did pose a genuine danger to the safety and well-being of another person as laid out broadly by the NFL https://t.co/4pY9GdwbOn",1554148196481347585,jjones9,45975888,2554632922
We need to be clear. The judge found Watson guilty of egregious behavior. She also imposed unprecedented rules because she clearly fears him reoffending. How you decide those two things and then come up with only six games. It is hard to understand,1554147983519784960,JoeBanner13,2756182062,2554632922
"Judge Robinson was bound by the personal conduct policy and in her role to rely on the NFL's definition of sexual assault, which was “unwanted sexual contact with another person.” She found Watson engaged in sexual assault (as defined by the NFL) against the four
therapists. https://t.co/2Ss2xhG9zN",1554147379200159745,jjones9,45975888,2554632922
