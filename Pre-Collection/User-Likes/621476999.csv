"11. Stop thinking about sleep as sacrificing productive time

Remember that sleep is one of the most productive things you can do.

If your goal is to have a full life then sleep ought to be a key priority. It extends the quality (and likely quantity) of your time here on earth.",1553083720512446467,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"10. Don't over-optimize

Research: trying to be perfect about sleep actually hurts sleep!

Our minds and bodies are unique. Each tip above will affect different people differently.

(For example: I can have coffee until about 4pm and still sleep well.)",1553083719434502147,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"9. Be consistent about when you go to bed and when you wake up

The brain and body love predictability and settling into a rhythm when it comes to pretty much anything, and this is especially true with sleep. Try not to vary either bedtime or waking up time by more than an hour.",1553083718218252291,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"8. Do everything you can to sleep well but do not freak out if you can't

Anyone who has ever had kids can tell you it's possible to function on poor sleep.

Stressing is pointless. It leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy and makes it less likely you'll sleep well the next night.",1553083717144526850,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"7. Keep your room cool

Your body cools during sleep. If you can help facilitate this naturally occurring cycle, all the better. This is highly individual but a good rule of thumb is two to five degrees lower than what you normally keep your thermostat at.",1553080321305968640,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"6. Keep your room dark

If you are noticing a theme, it's that your brain and body take their cues from the light around them. The darker your room, the more you are sending the message that it's time to sleep.",1553080320131567618,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"5. Limit alcohol

Though alcohol may help you fall asleep, it hurts the quality of your sleep and makes it more likely you'll wake up in middle of the night.

No drinks is better than one. One drink is better than two. Two is better than three. Three or more is simply unhealthy.",1553080318957076480,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"4. Cut out screens in 60 to 90 minutes prior to bed

-Blue light from screens basically tells your brain it's early in the day.
-Many screens we peer into (phones, laptops) contain stuff that stresses us out.

Ideally, no screens. But a fun TV show is much better than your inbox.",1553080317543596032,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"3. Limit caffeine to early in the day

Different people have different tolerances for caffeine. But for the vast majority of people, caffeine's stimulating effects shunt sleep. Based on the half-life of caffeine, a safe rule is to cut it out after 12 PM.",1553080316314763265,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
"2. Develop a regular physical practice

In addition to all its other benefits, physical activity also helps you sleep better at night.

Exercise at any time of day is better than no exercise. But for most people, exercising early in the day is best for sleep in particular.",1553080315148734464,BStulberg,363264237,621476999
