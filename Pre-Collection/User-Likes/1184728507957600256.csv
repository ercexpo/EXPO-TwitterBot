This was good to see.  Guy was a top 3 relief pitcher in baseball last year and half the fan base has given up on him.  Lets hope he‚Äôs turning a corner. https://t.co/geyRPqK3Vz,1553903963153612800,GODJ2,158041754,1184728507957600256
@PlayoffTanaka_ Not good. Let's hope him and Chappy can work through it in time. In the meantime other guys have to step up. Boone needs to start getting 6 and 7 innings out of starters save Cortes. These guys need to start building up that mental toughness for the stretch run and playoffs.,1553870251850448899,CardboardGlory2,1542935382999851012,1184728507957600256
