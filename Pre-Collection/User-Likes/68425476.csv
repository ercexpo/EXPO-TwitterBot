"HS Coaches, we have to do a better job strengthening our relationship with D2 Coaches. 

All the swing and misses by D1 schools might look bad on them but it’s killing the HS kid with D2 abilities.

We’ve got to make our kids more recruitable over a transfer

Great Coaches in D2!",1142828996469698560,GregWhite32,380707276,68425476
