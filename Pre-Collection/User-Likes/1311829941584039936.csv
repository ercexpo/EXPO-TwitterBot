"Coming off Huntington successfully getting 2 star players in Bailey Kelham and Peyton Hartsough, it sounds like they have some interest in the tall versatile forward in Grace Kreischer. 

Kreischer is a under appreciated defender that primarily rotates between the 3 and 4 slots https://t.co/tSuSb12o7M",1550206916986535938,SamTheManFrick,2602095690,1311829941584039936
