@DeepFocusReview @AlamoTwinCities His Oscar nomination! Do you have the 4K release? There are some new deleted scenes that have never been seen before including more with David Dukes before he was replaced by Richard Dreyfuss.,1549954808983044096,PaulsMovieTrip,96190876,2536497194
@DeepFocusReview @AlamoTwinCities It was so rewarding sharing my love for this movie knowing how many people were seeing it for the first time. I frequently think about the career River would have had. I was deeply affected by his death.,1549952957822763010,PaulsMovieTrip,96190876,2536497194
"@DeepFocusReview Love the conversation between Chris and Gordie about writing and Gordie dismissing his love for it.

Movie Review ~ Say Yup to Jordan Peele's #NopeMovie if you're down for an IMAX-sized dose of nerve-jangly scares ala Tremors &amp; Jaws. Overstuffed enough to become shapeless by the end...but it looks and sounds amazing throughout. #KekePalmer is a force! https://t.co/YXpkOEgkEk,1549786680860745733,joemnmovieman,62106475,2536497194
