@DrewDavenportFF How is ejaculating on a person that says no not a violent act.  Can the league as a private entity say we don't want you as part of our company anymore and basically fire him and fight the NFLPA over it Players can't want this in their league either.,1554262510567624706,NOHitmen_11,505100376,1017122589578354688

Could breakdown of the decision. Seems like she basically said 6 games is the precedent for punishment for similar conduct in the past so go with that. NFL can impose stricter penalties but has to give notice of that policy change first https://t.co/49yV0H8n2h,1554261851973726208,JustBeinHonest,51872294,1017122589578354688
