My favorite photo of Dad and Nichelle Nichols on set. The importance of Nichelle's legacy cannot be over-emphasized. She was much loved and will be missed. https://t.co/1zlTd4F9BD,1553847435968991232,adam_nimoy,1355398340,18739098
"Nichelle Nichols was The First.  She was a trailblazer who navigated a very challenging trail with grit, grace, and a gorgeous fire we are not likely to see again.

May she Rest In Peace.
