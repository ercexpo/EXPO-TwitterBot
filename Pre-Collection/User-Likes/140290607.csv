"A.J. Brown with the catch of camp so far. 9 route down the right sideline. Didn’t put his hands up until the last second (thus not tipping off the CB that the ball was arriving). Slay still got a hand on it, but Brown was able to pin the ball against his helmet with 1 hand.",1554477358366744586,JimmyKempski,291428201,140290607

"DeVonta Smith just cooked James Bradberry in 1v1. Perfect throw from Jalen Hurts into Smith’s bread basket. Bradberry’s spirits remain high after the rep. Let out a quick “Damn, Smitty!” before lining back up with the DBs.
