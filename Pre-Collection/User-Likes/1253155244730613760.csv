Hamdy Abdelwahab by KO/TKO/SUB
Moreno via decision
Nunes by KO/TKO/SUB

+1621 makes it feel like a mega-millions ticket.

Also like Lionheart Smith +400 just for frivolity.

Hamdy via finish +325 is my favorite wager tonight",1553522155882795010,takingtheover,1312800152625778690,1253155244730613760
