@FatboyFadeaway @droppedballspod @BJonesSports @MikePatton82 @strike7sports @Obstructedview2 @TheRealDealwDA @CHEN313 @DaOne_PShark I appreciate that bro! Thanks for listening. I'm really hoping my Rockets take notes from those Spurs and Warriors dynasties. Spurs and Warriors should be the blueprint for how a franchise is run.,1553175061699379201,CWoodOnSports,28745230,48442826

"@TheRealDealwDA @GridironHeroics @CHEN313 @droppedballspod @LVBenchWarmers @MikePatton82 @therealknelson @DaOne_PShark @courtney110979 @SportsProphet1 @Ruththetruthhh Curious to know why you did not focus on the fact that now Jameis Winston plays in a ball-control passing offense? As I predicted over a year ago, he was reborn!

I couldn‚Äôt  agree more with you regarding KD to Boston.. also love how you broke down the spurs and warriors keeping there core guys together and not panicking and trading guys and blowing it up.
Also good segment regarding UCLA /USC!",1553130573182300160,FatboyFadeaway,1294132675830099968,48442826
