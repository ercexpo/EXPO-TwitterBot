@49erscap @eric_crocker Awesome.  Would like to see them use any extra $ to sure you the oline.  Locked in at every other area.  That and extend Mosely.  Nice little 2 year extension now.  Reward him and get it done earlier before it gets expensive.,1553929654657904641,devil_red_deity,1260369278,984032060
