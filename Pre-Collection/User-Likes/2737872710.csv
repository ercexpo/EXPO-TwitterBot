"VINCE MCMAHON THREAD:

Rita Marie Chatterton was the first female referee in WWE in the '80s. She got into Vince's limo to discuss her contract, but was forced to have oral sex to save her career.

When she didn't agree, Vince allegedly raped her that night on July 16, 1986. https://t.co/f01DRekDMi",1537178782548709378,DrainBamager,2785952546,2737872710
