"You guys are asking me KD questions under every Dolphins/Marlins post. Here's the deal: Nets aren't tempted by Herro-led package.Heat's chances thus hinge on Durant insisting to be moved &amp; to only Miami/ Phoenix AND encouraging other teams not to pursue him, which hasn't happened",1549833863853228062,flasportsbuzz,501740046,65433023

"@Imman_Adan @Alf954 Per second spectrum Pascal averaged 0.9 ppp on 5.3 ISO‚Äôs per game last season. That put him in the 56th percentile among iso scorers.

He averaged 3 more ppg than Bam on 4 more attempts. There was a 3% USG gap bw them. Why the insistence the gulf bw them on that end is that big?",1549196634193420288,kellyoburner,1305376612263686146,65433023

The Miami HEAT are actively engaged in trade discussions with Dallas that would net a first round pick for Kyle Lowry. Dallas fully intends to back out at the very last minute and claim they misunderstood and thought they were acquiring Herro and Adebayo for a second-round pick.,1549121625949364226,SardineInsider,430338591,65433023
