@Kartervelli There are too many excuses being made surrounding conversations like this. Whether It’s about celebrities and how their talent surpasses their wrongdoings. Or how little girls are somehow to blame for GROWN ASS VOTING AGE MEN raping them. We need to do a serious self inventory.,1552211774476255232,Taiya_Wright,2188870649,238041621
@Kartervelli I need the Black community to understand that no matter how ‘Fast’ or ‘Grown’ a girl may be. CHILDREN CANNOT CONSENT to sexual relationships with Adults. It is ALWAYS rape no matter the circumstances &amp; it doesn’t matter if a lil girl ‘thinks’ she wants to do something. It’s rape.,1552211479683891204,Taiya_Wright,2188870649,238041621
