Staff here. I'm sad to say Bacchus has done his final pawtrol &amp; crossed the rainbow bridge. He's been fighting kidney disease for the past year and although his spirit was strong his body wasn't. Now he's free of pain and racing around dog heaven. 💔💔 #lastphoto https://t.co/7gs4P1C7sf,1548779597780492290,Bacchusboy,35706669,834427892490727424

"@aussomemiko Hi sweetheart. Happy Birthday. 
Don't worry! Mom will get herself together. You just do well in school and the big celebration she will give when you graduate will make up for all of it. Hope we are invited. Until then, be a good Collie and https://t.co/jFhCNNTZ7V",1548737237319393281,max10mil,913113385,834427892490727424
