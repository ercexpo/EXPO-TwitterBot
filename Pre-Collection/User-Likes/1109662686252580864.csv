"That's game. Pirates 5, Yankees 2

Suwinski and Vogelbach go deep. Tsutsugo and Gamel pick up a couple hits in their return from the IL. Quintana gives five strong and gets the win. Bednar the save.

Pirates win in front of a sellout crowd (first of the year) and improve to 33-47",1544503279870267392,AlexJStumpf,2186734351,1109662686252580864
