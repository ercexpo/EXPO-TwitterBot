"Anti choice rhetoric has always been logically inconsistent. It has always been shouted from the base of the moral hill it claims to die on. They believe that their rightness is an incontrovertible truth, so rationale, for them, is a mailable political tool, nothing more.",1548444043138330627,emrazz,30395567,80751127

The pivot forced birthers are doing on what abortions ‚Äúreally are‚Äù is something incredible to watch. They elle never have a ‚Äúare we the bad guys moment‚Äù. They‚Äôll just redefine abortion https://t.co/RQyHvwNkXF,1548424916109631490,r0wdy_,2185274887,80751127
