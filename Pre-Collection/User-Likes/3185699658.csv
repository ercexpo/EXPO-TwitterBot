Remember the Knicks did not come into this offseason with a Mitchell or bust mindset. It is clear that they felt the need to upgrade PG with Brunson and solidifying center. That they made an offer and  then have let Ainge stew suggests they like what they have.,1554429694396825600,Knickstape2005,3305886478,3185699658
