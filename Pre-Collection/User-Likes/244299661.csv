This is the same guy who defended it to the death last year when I inquired on his perplexing stance that Alexei Melnichuk projects to be an NHL goalie and Spencer Knight does not. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Now apparently Joe Garreffa (NOT WITH #SJSHARKS) &gt; Thomas Bordeleau. https://t.co/5z6SYFLuNs",1549253703726534656,KevinLacy22,118884861,244299661

@markEmarkSJS @CapFriendly Ah ha! Gotcha. 3C for Kunin? Seems like a big role for him‚Ä¶,1549148576214683648,EriktheRed92,1735824206,244299661
@markEmarkSJS @CapFriendly Got it. I thought you had Bordeleau there. Which wouldn‚Äôt make sense for his development,1549148438037684226,cavaca74,57672443,244299661
@markEmarkSJS The Dell signing is the only head scratcher for me. I guess they want a vet for the AHL squad given the new stadium and for an emergency call up/taxi squad situation since both AHL goalies have little to no AHL experience,1549143582229020673,mindtheoctopus,1190804037156913152,244299661
