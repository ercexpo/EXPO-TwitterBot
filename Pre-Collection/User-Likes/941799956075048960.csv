"2 years out, Chasing stupid fights has caused Garcia to lose this fight, Mikey was nowhere near his best and I'm also annoyed at his team for not telling him to pick up the pace and to land the combos. #GarciaMartin",1449577608446943233,BxngDaily,1213079168553906176,941799956075048960
We were all cracking jokes ringside at #GarciaVargas until Mikey put him on the floor with a right hand. Anything can happen. #boxing #GarciaMartin,1449569220958642185,OHaraSports,153320499,941799956075048960
