"So sick of the “D1 or Bust” mentality. And for what? So your parents can brag to friends? 

So few even GET the opportunity to play in college.

IF you get the chance to play at the next level...GO where you can get the best college experience &amp; degree. THAT'S what matters.",1541552960206823424,CoachLisle,46164938,3656452815
