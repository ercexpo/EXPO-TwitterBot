"@TenanATC I wonder if it actually takes hiring managers who know coding and what it does/doesn't involve to realize that. 

On paper it looks like ""we'll pay one person, and get the skills of many"".

The reality is the opportunity cost of burning time that's better spent elsewhere...",1547012976753790978,DrSianAllen,815430033862819840,1569456499
