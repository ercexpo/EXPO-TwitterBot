"@CodyCutter35 I was wrong, it was Rock River, and I did cover it. I also think this has to be one of the last times we used my original mug shot. Pretty sure we shot new ones right around this time, and still use those. 14 years ago, yikes. https://t.co/b5yanvNRrx",1511696458898194437,DanWoessner,318202675,1013757768
"@CodyCutter35 I meant Kishwaukee, not PrairieView. Kish won pretty much every year in that era.",1511439278399700995,DanWoessner,318202675,1013757768
"@CodyCutter35 I also tried to keep track and run stuff like that in agate or breakouts when I was SE. I have no idea if the old stacks still exist in Roxen though that I saved things too. But could be in previews, etc. from my SE period like 2011-2015.",1511439013265170433,DanWoessner,318202675,1013757768
"@CodyCutter35 I might have covered it. If I had to guess, it was PrairieView. If I covered it, I might have it at home. I can check but it might not be until tomorrow. The women's records were notoriously non-existent compared to the men's. Every time I asked, I mostly got laughs from ladies.",1511436806037852164,DanWoessner,318202675,1013757768

"@KenJacobySports From what I have been told, as a charter member, they can't be voted out. I don't see them leaving. Where would Alleman go? Three Rivers, Lincoln Trail? Maybe but doubtful.

"@KenJacobySports Alleman will fix its problems and will return to being a contender in the WB6, @allemanhs don't be so eager to kick them out. Give them time",1507480506023268354,vdawg68,271284335,1013757768
