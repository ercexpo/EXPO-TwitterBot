"@1Solidkhi @M9rcus2 @iamshane_ash @BatemansBurner @JoeyB Good work. You love to see it. 
Let me ask you this while I got you here. In the words of purple people, ‚Äúnobody played‚Ä¶we were injured‚Äù in that week 17 game you showed. But before Trevon Diggs‚Ä¶ there was a corner named Marcus Peters. Always burnt. Always gets picks.",1553793183313715201,zimwhodey,334216105,802242272263892992
