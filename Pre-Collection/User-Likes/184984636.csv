"@BrooksDSimpson Al Hambra.  I stood in the room where the last Sultan of Granada surrendered to Ferdinand and Isabella.

@BrooksDSimpson Grant Museum of Zoology--touched woolly mammoth hair. Isabella Stewart Gardner in Boston--so idiosyncratic. Westminster Abbey--so many little stories just abt the physical gravesites.
