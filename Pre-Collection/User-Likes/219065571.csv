I cannot begin to describe how hard we‚Äôve worked on this film. I know the film was landing because people were consistently focused on the screen. They were into it. There is nothing more rewarding than seeing that. People cheered. They cried. It was great.,1545411267472625665,pamsson,112736661,219065571
We screened #TheCaptain last night at Yankee Stadium. It may be the most surreal experience I‚Äôve ever had in my life. That felt like my World Series. It is incredibly humbling to see so many people come out to see a film I made in that building. I am forever grateful.,1545410792136245248,pamsson,112736661,219065571
