"I started a rewatch of #Vigil after watching #GentlemanJack several times. I am always amazed, when I see Suranne in a different role, bc she manages to not remind me at all of Anne Lister. Completely different person. I love her in all her roles. Legend. #SaveGentlemanJack https://t.co/jGc2Y5Aqpy",1551287381948616704,Cor0815,2959972077,307422748

🎶Oh Casey Boyes what shall we do?
We’ed hoped for series 3 but you’ve left us only 2.
Won’t you reconsider, bring Anne Lister back?
Much more to learn about our Gentleman Jack🎶

See @HBO there are still people discovering the show. With a little more promotion season 2 would have been a big hit. And hits bring subscriptions. #SaveGentlemanJack #HBOSaveGentlemanJack https://t.co/lFytuvsDQz,1551088958574043138,Cor0815,2959972077,307422748
