"@NFLFantasy_More This is a stunning take. The Tigers have the best manager in baseball, blue chip prospects in the pitching rotation and soon in the lineup. 

The Lions completely blew things up, went 3-13-1 last year, and aren't even close to a playoff appearance yet.",1509157462632538116,anthonytbroome,2321352516,554795099
2022 lions schedule over reaction…….10-7.   And I’m the biggest lions pessimist on earth.   What?  @FBGarbageTime https://t.co/Eh95tHfcls,1484259368262676483,NFLFantasy_More,554795099,554795099
164-107 on the year with picks.  Had a really rough stretch and pulled it together for a decent showing.  Over 60%. I’ll take it.,1480587229928075268,NFLFantasy_More,554795099,554795099

Great football season is now over.  First year I was serious about picking games against the number.  I was 40-18-1 on the year.  I learned a lot the first few weeks and went 33-8-1 after nfl week 5. Looking forward to next year. Thanks to @VegasSports for thoughts and advice https://t.co/vFwqeGpgG6,1224310950322491392,NFLFantasy_More,554795099,554795099
