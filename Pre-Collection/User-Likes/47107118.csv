"@CyrusShares Agreed, and this was something that experts warned about. An extra challenge is that Norway has no Gepards, so the issue was only found later.

But the good news is that the rounds can be fixed. Ukraine has 7 Gepards and circa 59,000 rounds that work which is plenty for now.",1553796266936750081,rminanoff,1487486586006687744,47107118
"@CyrusShares It's reporting based on a source that leaves out important information. The Gepards are operable.

Media reports detail the issues more accurately: It's only a problem is with replenishment ammo from a single Norwegian source (see last paragraph).

"@CyrusShares @IntelForMidEast @visegrad24 You are wrong.

There is no interoperability issue with newer systems, as the ammo made by the Norwegian manufacturer specifically for those Gepards.

There is is also a Forbes article on why Ukraine wanted the Gepards and how useful they can be:
