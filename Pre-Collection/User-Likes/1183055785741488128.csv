"A.J. Brown with the catch of camp so far. 9 route down the right sideline. Didn‚Äôt put his hands up until the last second (thus not tipping off the CB that the ball was arriving). Slay still got a hand on it, but Brown was able to pin the ball against his helmet with 1 hand.",1554477358366744586,JimmyKempski,291428201,1183055785741488128
"1 on 1: DeVonta Smith dusted James Bradberry for a deep TD. Jalen Hurts also connected with AJ Brown to beat Darius Slay, real impressive catch from the WR. #Eagles",1554476690663002112,BrandonGowton,172587248,1183055785741488128
