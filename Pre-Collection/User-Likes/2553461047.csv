"@JoolsNews Yes. It is quite close so you may still see some storms nearby. We give it a 20-25% chance of storms actually drifting into Beaumont, more likely they stay in the mountains. Keep an eye out later today!",1551574552622166016,NWSSanDiego,492586313,2553461047

"Here's the outlook for today's monsoonal convection! Best chances will be in the mountains and deserts. 

This will be more of a non-soon (see what we did there?) for most areas west of the mountains, with most storms expected to be very slow-moving upon developing.

"Thunderstorms are forecast to develop this afternoon over the mountains and deserts, but it will remain dry west of the mountains.

A few thunderstorms could produce downpours capable of localized flash flooding along with gusty winds. #CAwx https://t.co/f63zexrew5",1551551265347317760,NWSSanDiego,492586313,2553461047
