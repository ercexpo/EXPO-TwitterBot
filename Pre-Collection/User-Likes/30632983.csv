"The Democrat Portland Mayor, which has had about 60 days of riots and now another murder, blames it on @realDonaldTrump.

As NYC Mayor, I didn’t blame crime on Clinton. If I did, the NYT would have said I was a failed leader.

"Phrases the radical left adamantly opposes:

⛔️""I love America.""
⛔️""I appreciate the police.""
⛔️""We may disagree but I support your right to speak.""
⛔️""In God we trust.""

Their party is held hostage.

Remember this in November.",1300143377942376448,JDRucker,11622712,30632983
