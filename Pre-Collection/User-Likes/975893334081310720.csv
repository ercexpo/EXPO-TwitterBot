"Went to collect lost luggage at the airport, get told to wait at a meeting point, someone's coming down to see me.

Wait 30 mins, see a woman wave at me, I wave back. It must be her.

She awkwardly makes eye contact as her husband behind walks past me to her.

OK I'm die now.",1553235034534211584,GiggukAZ,228456219,975893334081310720

"@shYNY_Yordy i feel bad for Gallo, as he seems like a good guy. But he did not strike out so much because he was a Yankee. He struck out because MLB pitchers learned how to attack his swing effectively. He is not a major league hitter at this point. Perhaps he could be if he made adjustments.",1553088142143623174,bruce9876,1765491,975893334081310720
