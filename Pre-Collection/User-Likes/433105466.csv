"@craigb212 IMO Florial should have been in CF 3 months ago &amp; been forced to play himself off of the team. Same could be said about Andujar. In these spaces the Yankees lived up to the traditional definition of ""insanity"" as they trotted out the same guys daily: expecting different outcomes.",1553996613374410752,frummiee,56807262,433105466

@craigb212 You're being kind in your assessment of these fans. It is beyond idiotic to act like it was acceptable to bypass a real SS for a stopgap when this team's championship window is right now.,1553963869101608961,Yanksfan_03,618597885,433105466
"@craigb212 Other clubs think Volpe might be a solid player, but not a Jeter. The rest they don‚Äôt think that much of. 
Twitter prospect radicals thinks they will all be great. 
Of course, GMs are stupid and Yankees Twitter prospect huggers are genius. üôÑ",1553957852364038145,slingsingapore,84947115,433105466
@craigb212 Simply put the Yankees over reached this past offseason and fell short. IKF is stopgap at best and JD has been a negative as a hitter. This trade in the rear view mirror does not play. Probably no ability to fix this in 2022: but the Gallo situation should compel them to move on.,1553954230783852545,frummiee,56807262,433105466
@craigb212 IKF gets antsy on the easy plays: leading me to suspect that he loses focus. He gets himself into the correct position to make all of the plays. Not so for Torres-who has very limited range. IKF is a singles hitter: who without plus defensive play becomes utterly replaceable.,1553952728610750464,frummiee,56807262,433105466
@craigb212 The Yankees failed to capitalize on your analysis: seriously.,1553951567283363847,frummiee,56807262,433105466
"@craigb212 Not sure of the scenario that devolved from Castillo to whomever-but would not be surprised if owner Hal is very much involved. Cashman has been around for 26 years and knows that windows to win the WS can close quickly. Not sure about Hal; who's ""bottom line"" remains very green.",1553951100620996610,frummiee,56807262,433105466
@craigb212 The team that shows in the pst season will be the one that finishes the year. Their 1/2 was a perfect storm: with obvious holes not mattering. As they approach the post season everything will matter. This may be the last best opportunity to improve this team.,1553950049930977281,frummiee,56807262,433105466
@craigb212 Quintana is a weak back of the rotation guy. Would NOT spend much capital on acquiring him. He would NOT add much if anything.,1553949223548321793,frummiee,56807262,433105466
