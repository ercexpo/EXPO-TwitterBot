If there's proof of these women lying why would they still suspend Watson? Even if it is just for 4 games #Browns,1545120305462525954,Shy504693211,1528076405849964544,209163323
"53,000 &amp; counting! Regardless of the outcome or suspension, don’t forget who told the people first! So called new facts in this case are old. I take the heat for being a independent  thinker, but in the end vindicated by the research I put in!  https://t.co/DOVMxi95TZ #browns https://t.co/NRVHwRoZJb",1545118543439618053,Gbush91,86643419,209163323
@JosinaAnderson This type of information has been out there for weeks. I’ve tried to shed some light on it. JOSINA is as locked in as they come in the NFL.

"So the #Browns finally traded Baker, a.k.a. Johnny Manziel II, and he’s no longer in the #CLE.

I’m going to continue to blame #BakerMayfield anyway.
