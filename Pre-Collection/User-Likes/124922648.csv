@ksfortier He should have signed Johnny and traded for debrincat if he wanted to save his job. Figure out the cap later and moving guys out. Fans would have bought tickets.

@AttorneyZach @ksfortier @JimIkeHW Tell me where I said hockey isn‚Äôt a tough sport. I‚Äôll wait. I know what hockey is because I‚Äôve lived it. Being able to fight is less meaningful in todays hockey and doesn‚Äôt warrant a gross overpayment. Stick to law,1548389728558260226,Phlyers24,978726274779832320,124922648
