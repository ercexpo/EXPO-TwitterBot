"Since the Atlanta #Braves went on their run late last season, they are now 103-61 in their last 104 games.

They were 36-18 at the end of the 2021 regular season. They were then 11-5 in the postseason. And now, they are 56-38 in 2022.",1548780432296132608,BillShanks,37154497,344797732
19-10 is a 106 win pace over a full season. If 19-10 over 29 games isn't good enough as a fan then baseball probably isn't the sport for you https://t.co/imQskOxvRP,1548769531509633025,scottcoleman55,234090882,344797732
