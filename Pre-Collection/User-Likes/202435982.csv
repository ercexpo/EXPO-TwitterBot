"Notes:
1) said many times that Taylor-Britt can be a super star.

2) I couldn‚Äôt find anything on tape NOT to like about Zach Tom to be perfectly honest.

3) Alec Pierce will be the next guy that 3 years from now people will say ‚Äúhow the eff did he go in the 2nd rd???)",1527761617240334336,LRiddickESPN,1577522323,202435982
"@codiki Good point! Sorry for not checking that...
Honestly it‚Äôs hard for me to find a trade that would make me happy for the short or long term future for the Bengals. Not only because of Bates‚Äô talent but also because of the signal that will send to the Bengals‚Äô defensive players.",1527405014574039040,TurkishBengal,1512444116134678544,202435982

Shoot. We‚Äôve been writing about Burrow‚Äôs ice since he got drafted. But that question elicited a great response. https://t.co/4IWHpv41UF,1527029416605409280,Ben_Baby,187626332,202435982
