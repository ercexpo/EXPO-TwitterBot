"@sportsmockery @Money23Green Rodman would be defending Durant considering the forward matchup, Pippen would be guarding Steph and Thompson would be guarded by Jordan. Green might not be as effective as people believe if the Bulls are able to counter the screen-game he provides. The game depends on what rules",1552743726719582208,ventazones,4827637937,169760946
@oledefense1033 I think the '22 warriors represented the current NBA culture of get into the playoffs healthy even at the expense of losing some games in the reg season.  Steph didn't play in the last month.  It would be better to compare the playoff stats.,1552459659285610496,jessepittsley,51743872,169760946
