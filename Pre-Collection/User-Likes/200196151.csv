"@LaurasMiscMovie I have East of Eden, too. It's been years since I watched it, however. Until September isn't for everyone. It has a cult following. You might want to fast forward through about a minute of it. Thinking of the No Way Out scene that you didn't care for. It has a beautiful score.",1554312077958959104,AA8783H,3003877548,200196151

My family is obsessed with shark movies at the moment. We’ve seemingly run out of good ones (we’ve seen a lot of em). Can anyone recommend some under the radar good ones? Or even bad but bonkers / entertaining? https://t.co/nPonEMEkec,1554307355319226373,bobfreelander,18223439,200196151
