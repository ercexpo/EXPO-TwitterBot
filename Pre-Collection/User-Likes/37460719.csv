@MarlowNYC @CandeyQ My favorite part of the movie. He knew exactly just how to blow it up. And it‚Äôs a testament to Timmy and Mich√¥d for not letting him walk away with the movie at the end.,1553579957426614273,scotty1123,120247553,37460719
"I'm not saying HHH shouldn't get praise for every positive move he makes, all the stuff I just said. I'm just saying, he has been put in as low a pressure situation as running the WWE could ever be, and all he has to do to be a hero is turn things from a 3 to a 6.5. It's a dream.",1553573955641872384,TrevorDame,465687213,37460719
