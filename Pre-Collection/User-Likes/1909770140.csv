@chad_minton It would bring up another problem for sure but replacing a third pairing defenseman is a ton easier the finding what Matthew brings to the table. The impact he adds to the forward group would be unbelievable. This is how you box with the Avs. Just my honest take. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1549507993754107905,PredsMatt502,1514669682,1909770140

@chad_minton Agree. I'm holding out hope for Boeser or Garland.,1549500988192706560,GrantDBrasher,25874957,1909770140
