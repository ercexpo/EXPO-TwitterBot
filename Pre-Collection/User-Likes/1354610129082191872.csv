"@PunishedCaleb I feel bad for Bruce and glad you posted his comments.   He replaced a very popular coach and many were unhappy with the situation (not BW personally)

If you follow the program,  you quickly realize his opinion doesn't match Coach Tangs reality. 

Wish him every success.",1553686723770474496,Polymorphic1019,1518680311294566400,1354610129082191872

@JohnRob1965 @PunishedCaleb Don‚Äôt disagree. Snyders first stint was the greatest coaching job of all time. No one‚Äôs saying Snyder was a bad coach he could win cfb games with a high school. However the style of ball he coached in his second stint almost killed everything he ever built.,1553582104616779776,k_oliverchest,1497790140521009157,1354610129082191872

@PunishedCaleb Facts.. Snyder should‚Äôve left after 2014. Him trying to win football games by playing smash mouth football set the cats back as a program tbh. Lot of quality players in the past 5 years that should‚Äôve came and played for KSU didn‚Äôt because the style of football wasn‚Äôt attractive.,1553563383961616386,k_oliverchest,1497790140521009157,1354610129082191872
