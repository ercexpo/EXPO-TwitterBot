"I just hung up with an American League executive who I have known for 20+ years and I asked him about the Cubs trade of Scott Efross. ""They got a starter who will be a part of their rotation. Not a top end guy but they made a fine trade. Efross is 28. They made a fine trade.""",1554196629829435395,thekapman,22445483,256287179
"The #Bears have received calls and have held trade talks centered around OT Teven Jenkins, sources tell me and @MikeGarafolo. The former 2nd round pick has drawn interest based on his potential. A situation to watch.",1554194648221958144,RapSheet,16403943,256287179
"@DOM_Frederic Cubs fans only talk about the rebuilds that work but it‚Äôs crazy to see how much they ignore the Sox who went through an extensive, brutal rebuild and do not seem positioned anywhere to close to a World Series contender (because they forgot to account for defense lol)",1554191779687186434,tyxwin619,2547334535,256287179
"Cubs turned Effross into a sidearmer in 2020. Hughes went into 2019 as an outfielder. Alzolay and Steele didn't throw sliders until 2020. Uelmen debuted after being in the minors for five years.

I don't think the Cubs do this trade without these results on the pitching side.",1554189937666408448,GoCubs49,2721932563,256287179

I‚Äôm glad Effross got traded to a team whose fans worship their good relievers so I still get to watch his highlights all the time.,1554175938983854080,GoCubs49,2721932563,256287179
