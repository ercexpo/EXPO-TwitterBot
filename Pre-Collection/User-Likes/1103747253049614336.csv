"I listened to it. Unfortunately Whit just doesn‚Äôt seem to get why people are upset.

@KG_Chief Its Whit by a country mile. Contract negotiations go like this sometimes in all levels of all sports and it mostly has to do with the agents. Whit's statement is a stand alone one of a kind embarrassment. And I'm a big fan of his.,1547990216970907658,mloe68,85397805,1103747253049614336
