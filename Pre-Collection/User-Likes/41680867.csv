"@RobLMyers This would be a great time for F1 and its journalists to start calling this sort of thing out and stop platforming these views.

If they choose not to it shows they have learnt nothing from the countless racists incidents we have seen within the sport this season alone.",1552737087320997888,Db1995F1,1438422893084483588,41680867
