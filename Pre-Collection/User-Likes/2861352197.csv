She does. Johnny Depp gets to be in conversations about raping and torturing teenagers and it‚Äôs ignored. He gets to payout for assaulting a coworker and ignored. He gets to say child rapist aren‚Äôt predators &amp; ignored. He gets to abuse her and ignored. #AmberHeardDeservesAnApology,1554143240017821696,BertLoch,458670381,2861352197

That's not how fucking art works esp when the films themselves are explicit criticism of rape culture and fascism. And its esp gross to be targeting ppl (who aren't the two abusers this started with) and calling them degenerates for the crime of finding meaning in a film,1554122402010890243,ScaredBisexual,1185730770813571072,2861352197
I dont give a shit if someone never wants to watch Sal√≥ or I Spit on Your Grave or any film which includes depictions of rape and torture. What crosses a line for me is the insinuation that anyone who watches and thinks those films are good are guilty by association,1554122397510520839,ScaredBisexual,1185730770813571072,2861352197

Like at some point when u start denying reality you just become completely entrapped in this delusion. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening for them.

"@DawsonEJoyce they were made with intent to be, i believe, but very poor reaction to season 1 of agents of shield (and in general despite the show getting very good) made them nix it immediately",1553936582180081666,morguetalk,832255123,2861352197
@DawsonEJoyce theyre literally confirmed to not be. same as agents of shield and their spin-offs. theyre in a second canon based off of events that happened in the first canon. but nothing they do will ever re-connect into the first canon,1553935923364052992,morguetalk,832255123,2861352197
