@DanonymousMan @atTheTrack7 Sorry to read your family did the same to you Dan. Neither of you deserve to have to go through that. As you said hold close the people that matter. The family you choose so you speak rather than the family by blood.,1539421137209270277,dave_zenner,513479952,221098962
@atTheTrack7 That is just awful to read Darin. The idea of everyone cutting your immediate family out of their lives is nothing short of tragic. Hopefully when your children‚Äôs cousins get older they will free themselves from the hate their elders possess.,1539420702562045952,dave_zenner,513479952,221098962
