Sox should make a run for Hosmer right now. They will attach prospects to get rid of him and probably eat $$. He‚Äôs still a good player. He has 3/39 left on deal. Play him at 1B this year and take ur time w/Casas. Do it. Do it. Do it,1554515248350216193,LouMerloni,60600106,1214394046250176512
"Anyone giving Eric Hosmer shit right now, ask yourself if you‚Äôd want to leave San Diego for friggin‚Äô DC. Take out the fact that the Padres just acquired the modern day Ted Williams and the Nats suck. You‚Äôre not leaving based on geographical location alone.",1554515197850681345,Jared_Carrabis,59345386,1214394046250176512

"I kind of feel for Hosmer. He went there when they were awful and rebuilding (yes they gave him the best deal) but now they need to agree to be traded away when the team is ready to compete.
