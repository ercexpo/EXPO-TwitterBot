@Flipsteeler Right. Still have room to make moves but the cap space vs usable is quite a difference.,1537533855720263690,Alex_Kozora,608546437,49530294
@Flipsteeler GMKC never negotiated. They make a decision to offer or not and then Omar takes over. Surely ARII has final say. I don't think this is a change. I think it is treating stars differently and rightfully so,1537261898172874754,MarkKaboly,54671653,49530294
@Flipsteeler Heyward's first extension was July 17. Pouncey did his first extension on June 12.,1537258647067283457,MarkKaboly,54671653,49530294
@Blitz_Burgh Aaron Rogers sat till 25. Steve Young was drafted at 24 and started for the niners at 30. Kenny sitting a year will be best for him,1537242072457043968,XcLEWsive_one,367676074,49530294
@zdonaldson07 @RileyHann @Flipsteeler @Blitz_Burgh First third of the season allowed 17 of 21 passes for 2 TDs and 128 opposing QB rating. Worse missed tackle percentage than Edmunds who everyone loves to crucify. It is what it is.,1537233770444599296,DavidAFrey,466922680,49530294

@Flipsteeler @Montejp231 @PFF @PFF_Sam @49ers Prob not since we have ebukam who came on strong as hell last year when he got acclimated to the postion and he‚Äôs really good against the run too. Drake will be that 3rd down speed rusher to start but he can thrive in that spot for sure bookended with Bosa. Excited for him,1536782524801855492,badmanbatesbuck,1105835324335374336,49530294
