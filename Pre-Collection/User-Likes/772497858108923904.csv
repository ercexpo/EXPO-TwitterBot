"Taking Edwards. Both women tend to lean on some pretty repetitive 1-2s, but Edwards hits harder and I'm not trusting this BW move for Kim. #UFC277",1553516307349327872,BloodyElbow,19882533,772497858108923904
"Cosce back into back mount, dropping heavy strikes. Diamond flops back to his back and puts Cosce in half guard. Cosce gonna ride this out for the win. 29-28 Orion Cosce. @MMADecisions #UFC277",1553508304462106624,BloodyElbow,19882533,772497858108923904
