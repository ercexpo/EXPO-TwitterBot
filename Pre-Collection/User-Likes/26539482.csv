"California wants more taxpayer dollars to fight their homelessness problem.

Hell no. You people care more about illegal immigrants than your own citizens.

You built it, YOU fix it.

"@TheBrianBateman You‚Äôre a hell of an analyst 1st you have Mc over Koep for Player of Yr I guess you think a 30 man field tournament equals a major. Now, you have Im R of Yr I guess because you value  participation over winning Is that because you participated a lot but rarely won",1166866357985644544,skeeterfl,26539482,26539482
@McIlroyRory I know u couldn‚Äôt care less but I lost some respect for u after you basically disparage the Majors.
