Drake London is probably the best redzone WR In this draft. He has great hands and he can hold his blocked. I believe he has the most upside #NFLDraft2022 https://t.co/BjrmCdKljy,1495427717994582022,TheSportshub28,1494708226180399104,1494708226180399104
Jameson Williams is the best deep ball threat in this year daft with his lighting speed. He quick off the line. Doesn‚Äôt have a problem with man coverage. My problem with him is how fresh his injury is but his talent keeps him #6 #NFLDraft2022 https://t.co/1lxaAdXwqD,1495427344802193409,TheSportshub28,1494708226180399104,1494708226180399104
John metchie lll is a quick off the line and can find any open whole door in the defense. I have him at 4 because of his injury but with his overall talent I believe he is still a first RD. #NFL https://t.co/imgQyFI3Dg,1495427341668995089,TheSportshub28,1494708226180399104,1494708226180399104
Chris Olave probably the best route runner in the year daft. He knows how to find the open zone and has great track like speed. I personally haven‚Äôt watched a lot on him so that‚Äôs why he is my #3 WR he could move up #NFLDraft2022 https://t.co/BKTmmm9Nnk,1495427338007461888,TheSportshub28,1494708226180399104,1494708226180399104
George Pickens probably one of the best all round players. He can line up outside or in the slot. He is a great red zone threat with 50/50 balls and can be used in the run blocking game. #NFL #NFLDraft https://t.co/u7pfJTXglA,1495427334652178432,TheSportshub28,1494708226180399104,1494708226180399104

Brian Robinson is probably the best power back in this year daft he had good ball carrier vision and pass blocking ability. He can also be a threat catching the ball. #nfl https://t.co/PotOPKdUU4,1495243714884775936,TheSportshub28,1494708226180399104,1494708226180399104

Bailey Zappe I believe could be a late round steal. He make decisive read down field and he can extend the play with his mobility although it‚Äôs not the best. I believe he could play a Ryan tannehill role for the falcons https://t.co/Gs4LuncL9E,1495154024768753666,TheSportshub28,1494708226180399104,1494708226180399104
Cameron Thomas has really good hands getting off of blocks. He can track down the ball once is in the pocket and does a good job of not getting to wide. His ability to play in a 3-4 or 4-3 scheme is very helpful and could a good duo with Grady Jarrett. https://t.co/mVnseYMPWa,1494932800675454976,TheSportshub28,1494708226180399104,1494708226180399104
