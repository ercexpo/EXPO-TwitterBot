@Carrie__Jessica Talented or not .. Let them remove their content and leave. They did no good to everyone by exploiting the system as they made cc creation more about money and less about the game and sharing among the community. It went too far .. their prices are higher than EA packs sometimes,1553962901429538816,NerdySnailie,950210840044691456,14679555
@missingwerewolf @jinxnoodles @Carrie__Jessica It was always illegal to do. It‚Äôs like those who made income from selling counterfeiting and now they are being legally obligated to follow the rules. That‚Äôs not art or honest income. They were just abusing the system and made it worse to everyone else who followed it.,1553960571304902656,NerdySnailie,950210840044691456,14679555
@kikipeachywitch Those people who abused the system and sold cc packs/kits in prices higher or equal to the game content caused this. They made it hard for everyone else who adhered to the rules . It‚Äôs not 2-3 creators even .. the list is long! It‚Äôs a shame but they had it coming.,1553958484298932225,NerdySnailie,950210840044691456,14679555
"@PansexLuvsYou @NicPW82 @xxtinkerbell But they should because it's part of the contract they agree to by creating content for the game. Even if they never read it, it exists. Ignorance is not an excuse for paywalling content indefinitely or whatever else went on.",1553955232434065411,hkpstreams,1203542780603174913,14679555
This ain't a loophole tho. LMAOOOOOO!!!! Package files are EA's IP... and ain't nobody downloading models to make they own shit. LMAOOOOOO https://t.co/b9URD8txev,1553952874417340417,SimDivaBleu,813837313,14679555
"@harasnicole ohhhh ok so just like any other game modders, bcs i‚Äôm also from the minecraft community and i have never seen a modder make their supporters pay so it makes sense",1553952344404008961,keesoull,1386519918464618496,14679555
@simskazoo @xxtinkerbell I hope sincerely that most people didn't pay for early access as much as they just paid to support the creator cause they had the extra. And that they will definitely continue to do so!,1553952186127761415,SimmyTransy,1141048279616151553,14679555

"@harasnicole @mindless_kelsy ohhhh i remembered that rule, but i guess now they are actually implementing it fr?",1553950984438784000,keesoull,1386519918464618496,14679555
@PansexLuvsYou @xxtinkerbell Not when you use another product to make your creations. I make cc and would never charge for it. I'm not greedy,1553950569378844672,NicPW82,394959984,14679555
