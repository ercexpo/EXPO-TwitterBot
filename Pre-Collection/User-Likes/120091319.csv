When people ask me why I coach.  Here’s my why.  Had the chance to coach an amazing group of young ladies this summer.  Went 13-4 in July and 24-6 overall as the youngest team on the 15U EYBL circuit.  Love these kids to death and was lucky to be their coach ⁦@philly_rise⁩ https://t.co/lqyCjUbiJ7,1551304267264294912,abriancreech,362865891,120091319
