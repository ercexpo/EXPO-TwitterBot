I‚Äôm amped up for this season to begin. Some haven‚Äôt learned from the past. Let them doubt us again. The most difficult part is having to wait another 45 hours to kickoff. #PlaceAtTheTable https://t.co/BCrNkAckEP,1032449414818881541,MikeLusch,402406851,707076828402479104

"You can complain about things you can't control or you can control what you can control and let go of what you can't. You can focus on your problems or focus on getting better. You can look for an excuse or you can look within and find your best.

Make the positive choice today. https://t.co/2pxm3x6PUb",1030416137723502592,JonGordon11,22870549,707076828402479104

"TENSIONS RISE
A few Limeport Bulls fans let the umpires have it after tonight‚Äôs Game 3 of the @BMLScores finals was stopped in top of 7th due to darkness. The Bulls had rallied to take a 9-8 lead in 7th but when game was called, score reverted back to end of 6th. Giants win 8-7. https://t.co/PpbopofvFC",1029897424381403141,KeithGroller,63520432,707076828402479104
