I like what I’m seeing out of ‘25 Xavier Ferguson. He’s been good on both ends of the floor. Can make plays on and off the ball. Athletic shifty guard that just missed the poster dunk of the day over a 6’7 forward. good downhill attacker @labroncos2024 @PHCircuit #PHAtownshowdown,1530568668253507586,AP_Writess,851833170,1127781352726781952
