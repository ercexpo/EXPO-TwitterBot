"A lot of athletes want to be known as a worker/a player who loves getting better &amp; cares about performance, but very few players consistently put in the work that it takes to be successful. If players actually worked as hard as they claim, we’d have a lot of accomplished players!",1547286028695789568,CoachJonBeck,85164967,4898044585
"You don’t have to score all the points to get noticed during the AAU season. 

Play HARD defense, be a good teammate, and be coachable. 

If I was a coach that’s what I’m looking for in my recruits 💪🏼🏀",1547271153374437377,lakenjames5,255267905,4898044585

"Uncoachable players feel others owe them something without earning their status, position, or respect. They believe they will get better just because they have ""experience"", but they never actually learn. They resist someone teaching them because they know enough already.",1546887210150100992,CoachBechler,278903615,4898044585

"PLAYERS:  When you are on the bench, you never know when Coach will put you into the game. It is important to be an active observer, stay mentally (and physically) ready, and learn as much as you can by watching. Don't make mistakes that a teammate might have previously made!!!",1546841890934460417,CoachBechler,278903615,4898044585
"Prospects: 
Coaches are evaluating more than basketball. Roadblocks in recruiting: 
1.  Entitlement
2. Selfishness
3. Laziness
4. Poor body language
5. Bad attitude",1546841831853461505,PaulBiancardi,183665224,4898044585
