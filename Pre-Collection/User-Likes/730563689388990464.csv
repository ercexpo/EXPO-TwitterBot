How many Edge players come straight from high school and into college programs and start/contribute from day 1 my quick research shows hardly any.That’s a grown man position. The Will Harris’s and Dallas Turners of the Wrld are rare.,1554212858791084032,40AcresLandLord,961651553185751041,730563689388990464

@Dewayne42005783 @jz62980 @HornsFan29 …hasn’t landed one? I heard that Coach PK helped to steal this one out of Nicholas Lou Saban’s backyard… I mean I could be wrong though https://t.co/PtRjF6UsHk,1554208495867727873,aprilPINKie,317623727,730563689388990464
"It’s been reported since the beginning Vasek’s preference was to leave the state. Seemed like Clemson early on, and Oregon may have proven to be too far distance. Next best option was Norman. 

Recruit Shelby &amp; Wilson thru December, and hope this is an afterthought l.",1554208438615285763,Doc_Texas,61293257,730563689388990464
"No fluff, just EVERY SINGLE play our run defense had. Was the defense as bad as you thought or was it due to other factors like volume?

Only one way to find out...TAP IN!!!

I think it would have made the defense better last year because A) They wouldn't be learning their 3rd defense in 3 years B) Ash's defense asks players to do less C) We didn't have the players that were made for PKs scheme https://t.co/iFZZZY1nNP,1554206273532567552,realscientistic,954811536,730563689388990464

@DTraiN5795 @TXFootballTalk Same people were wetting their pants over OL recruiting last year. Not going to lose all faith because we lost a couple guys who were long shots anyway.
