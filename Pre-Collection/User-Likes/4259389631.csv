This is why I feel like they're struggling with quantity over quality.  This is so many stories to develop....so many writers/directors to recruit and shepherd...so many effects to produce.  It's too many balls to juggle at once. They're going to start dropping  a few. https://t.co/2AuobnZzZu,1546655555103735808,kirkneverdied,1471126159,4259389631

From Porky's stutter, to Daffy/Sylvester's lisp, and to Bugs Bunny's New York accent, he's a natural talent.

Season 4 is wildly uneven in terms of story and pacing, yet when the show hits ‚Äî it hits HARD in both spectacle and emotion. Episode 4 and Sink are still MVP. https://t.co/2tnb6UhSUA",1543640283631468547,Cine_Mann,2888632864,4259389631
