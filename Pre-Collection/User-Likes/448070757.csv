"Ludwinski says the Blackhawks showed the most interest in him and he had a gut feeling he‚Äôd be picked 39th. Says he‚Äôs versatile like Yanni Gourde, can play 1st to 3rd line, center or wing.",1545431108254400515,BenPopeCST,3873832839,448070757
The Shane Wright death stare at the Habs table... top 10 moment in draft history.,1545261082549178369,ByronMBader,348524843,448070757
"Korchinski and Nazar are both known as highly competitive guys who can really skate. Those are two most important things a prospect can have in my opinion. That gives them a floor and it creates a winning culture. No more Nylanders, no more Boqvists, no more Nick Schmaltzes.",1545238050963349504,BarstoolChief,292508851,448070757
"Rinzel said the Blackhawks showed the most interest in him of any team throughout the season, and when he heard they'd traded up to 25th, his heart started racing.",1545236671368761347,BenPopeCST,3873832839,448070757

"Nazar is a really good skater, and a forward, so this is a lot more in line with what we thought the Hawks would prioritize. He's a Michigan commit.",1545209429615943688,BenPopeCST,3873832839,448070757
"Kevin Korchinski said he compares his game to Shea Theodore. Confident, likable guy. He never even met with the Blackhawks, had no idea his name was going to be called 7th overall.",1545204406483828741,BenPopeCST,3873832839,448070757
