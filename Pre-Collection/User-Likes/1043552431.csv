"Underrated two hitter who had a .350+ OBP in ‘93 and ‘94. The type of player that isn’t a star and isn’t many people’s favorite player, but is an integral part of a great team behind many plays and sequences that lead to wins. https://t.co/AmYPAV4J6Z",1553950912401608704,LastComiskey,1355541883271999488,1043552431
