"@Sfh986 I dont think 'screwed' is the right term, but the FIA bent the rules significantly to get a lap at the end",1470044496570241028,Darren_J96,185215596,1104189902793539584
"@Sfh986 So basically, the 2 options at the end for the FIA was to either not let the lapped cars past and get 1 racing lap in at the end or to let them all pass which would have taken 2 laps meaning the race was over.

But instead, thry just let a few go and hotshotted the start again",1470044273794068481,Darren_J96,185215596,1104189902793539584

It feels like the Clippers can just take it to the rim whenever they want against the Blazers. Like the Blazers have the worst Defensive Rating in the league or something.,1468086054779437059,Farbod_E,74808913,1104189902793539584
