The #49ers defense is as stubborn as I‚Äôve ever seen it. Receivers rarely running open and rushing lances closing quickly. Trey Lance is continually evading pressure - the entire left side of the offensive line collapsed by Nick Bosa and Samson Ebukam on one rep. Relentless.,1554558902632452097,Rob_Lowder,156813016,443472708
