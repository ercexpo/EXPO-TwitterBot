All the talk is about MLS and Liga MX merging in some way… but I’d argue American soccer has grown so much in the past decade that it’s time to start considering cutting the Canadian MLS clubs loose. Canada (and @CPLsoccer) needs them more to grow their own game.,1543421275342721024,jonahfreedman,38443170,1304574648038817792
