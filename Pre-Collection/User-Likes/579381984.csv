@RatedWrestling_ He helped control the landing so that Jimmy ended up in a safe spot. You see Jimmy attempt to sandbag Brock for that same reason. If Brock just tossed him he may have landed on the sharp edge of the table and been hurt badly.,1553956940174266368,StatGuyGreg,3236570703,579381984
@RatedWrestling_ To make sure he didn't hurt him,1553954946168545282,Dytraider,186252668,579381984
