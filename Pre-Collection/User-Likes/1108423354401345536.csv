"Kevyn Adams has added 22 players to the Sabres‚Äô prospect pool in the last two drafts. 

He currently has 8 picks next year with 4 of those picks coming in the first 2 rounds. (one 1st and three 2nds)",1545485138657779712,MattKopnak,68281441,1108423354401345536
For some odd reason I love that Adams used all his picks. It probably has to do with his actions matching what he is saying in the press. He wants to fix the prospect pool and build organically. Infusing 11 kids into the system is great step towards achieving that.,1545477813620318210,MattKopnak,68281441,1108423354401345536
