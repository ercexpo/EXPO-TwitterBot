Who knows, what tomorrow will hold
But I know that we'll be alright•

My heart is broken 💔

"I can’t begin to express how I feel right now. This video was taken during our last performance together in Liverpool just 2 weeks ago that will stay with me forever. Thank you Tom for bringing your light to the world. I hope we meet again one day, rest well, brother. https://t.co/GYyKCsPCWt",1509560364752678918,NathanSykes,90896009,231728667
