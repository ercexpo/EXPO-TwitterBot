"@AGToddRokita Nowhere in this list of developmental milestones does it say a ten-year-old should carry a baby.

@CoachJimmyJ @AlexGoldenNBA Anyone that watched him at Ohio State knew what we were getting. He‚Äôs an inefficient volume shooter on offense. Undersized defensively. I look at it this way. He helped the tank to get us Mathurin. He‚Äôs a G league player at best. I expect him to get waived.,1547051564501798915,rsharp1122,701448270330122241,431253601
@AlexGoldenNBA I tried to tell you all last season he was a product of the sorry season and was not a legit NBA player,1547048948480856066,CoachJimmyJ,29090474,431253601
