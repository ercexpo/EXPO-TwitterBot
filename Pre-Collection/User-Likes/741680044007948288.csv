He will be great as Steph successor. JP got his own unique skill set and he is improving each season. https://t.co/z7GCJ1j8Zs,1553050439784214528,CurryTrae,948845720454422529,741680044007948288

"@ThePackageJG I think the takeaway, as always, is that Steph is the GOAT, and the rest of the dudes just need to be good-to-great every other game and the Warriors win every series they are in...",1553044956520091651,SFLGT,1055159919924531200,741680044007948288
@ThePackageJG so they were pretty crucial to the Warriors winning 3-4 of the 4 wins in the series... idk man. they weren't *bad* it's a tough series vs the best defense in the league. you're not gonna play perfectly every night. Unless you're Steph.,1553044009051951104,SFLGT,1055159919924531200,741680044007948288
"This is not about how good Steph is, he's a top-10 player of all-time and arguably the most impactful offensive player of all time. The greatness is unquestionable.

Is Steph Curry really better then Devin Booker or is he just in a better system?",1553040224074211328,aryh21,1216888815639564288,741680044007948288

@ThePackageJG Also one of Steph‚Äôs strengths is being efficient in even bad situations tho I will say he‚Äôs played off ball with no spacing. If he was allowed to be on ball‚Ä¶,1553031473686618112,aryh21,1216888815639564288,741680044007948288

"Think this is why Boston should go for KD. Getting over the hump to actually win is hard. Coming in 2nd doesn‚Äôt really tell you how far you might be off.

Only 6 out of these 15 made it back (5 won it). And all of those had established All-Time guys (Kobe, Duncan, Lebron, Steph). https://t.co/rRKQlaGFvM",1553015733671473152,fakelogic,523931563,741680044007948288
