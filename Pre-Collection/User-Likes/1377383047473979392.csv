@OGtexasrunner @BarryRoland19 As a landlord in Chicago I can confirm. Most of my tenants are running month to month even if credit and income is good. Maybe they are stacking loot in an IRA or maybe they are hording Funko Pops...,1553571356129869826,JoeHoulihan35th,926439640608989184,1377383047473979392

Good morning 🌞 I think I need to stay off Twitter 🤦‍♂️ At this point I’m not even taking out my finds of the bags. The Amazon box has the Doctor Strange possible chase and look @MajinE_Mimi Still haven’t set up my echo dot 🤷‍♂️ Just not feeling it today hope it passes #FunkoPOP https://t.co/senMKUbkPL,1551218279137558528,Topetahpbpn,1326053602767630338,1377383047473979392
Thank God for free refills at Six Flags with an annual membership.  Think this is the 10th refill of the day so far just for me.  Over 100 degrees at this dang place! Happy to have found a table in the shade! https://t.co/89o3XIaC2o,1550965816195162114,wildfortoys,1865439847,1377383047473979392
I've owned my fair share of Freddy's... but over time I realized I would never own some I really wanted so I decided to sell mine and trust me the people that got these from me got deal. But they went to people who appreciate it more than me. To that's what collecting is about. https://t.co/ubI3iaDdc7,1550964353322496002,pophawk84,1454235160455483398,1377383047473979392

I got excited just for a second. This would’ve been my first chase in the wild except they wanted $50 each for them. That’s not finding the Chase that’s buying the chase. He said is there anything else I can do for you? I said no I won’t be back. #GameNut #Chase #BuyingTheChase https://t.co/4iEp1cxigV,1544376457669054464,Topetahpbpn,1326053602767630338,1377383047473979392
