Sunday morning’s 18KM went pretty good! Got up early enough that it only felt too hot for the last 4KM. 😅 Gotta get my butt out the door earlier &amp; earlier to beat the heat! #marathontraining #runchat #fitness #selfcare https://t.co/qU2jDd6GUO,1554088060962459649,CrystalRunsFree,23624120,3160183880
