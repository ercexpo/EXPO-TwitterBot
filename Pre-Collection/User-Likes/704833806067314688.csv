"2 cents getting thrown in.
I'd like new art ideas for movie posters please.
Like what kind of wall have you hit when every poster looks like a a flower of characters blooming out. This a tired artwork, and frankly I'm sick of it. https://t.co/dQvzMm6V8f",1554503525576544258,ViconiShow,1463382074,704833806067314688
I guess Asuna does have a signature pose üò≠ https://t.co/olQWm6lkmv https://t.co/W6Vgd7RrnT,1554503504626163714,Stacyiuh,1502573452699525127,704833806067314688
"@DJ__Paint Usually I'm not a fan of the bloom of characters posters.
I wish they could be more creative with movie posters. Like say, a perspective of behind the 2nd floor boss's mouth with sharp teeth and past it you see Kirito and Asuna looking up at the boss...
But that's just my idea",1554502378577006593,ViconiShow,1463382074,704833806067314688
To this day i still can‚Äôt believe we got to see Darkseid and The Justice League come face to face in live action https://t.co/XDf6BWtcq4,1554502003858046976,nightwaynes,1233076435528622081,704833806067314688
Zack Snyder‚Äôs Superman is a better written character than Homelander and is 10x more interesting,1554499285965836291,SnyderVerse18,1465722687192510467,704833806067314688
The new artwork looks like a superhero movie poster. https://t.co/8U2rav98Oq,1554497965598859264,RenanSintese13,1117072617180102659,704833806067314688

I love them both. But I kind like the right one more. It‚Äôs just cool to see Asuna front and center. https://t.co/Mw8ui1UcAo,1554492805887705090,KotoVortex,1248251442500173825,704833806067314688

@kabukibutterfly How they fight for each other and how their love shines through. Sadly a few of those other western shows got stuck in shipping and they are having a difficult time getting out. Hopefully it will happen soon. So they can have a moment like the one Luz and Amity had https://t.co/aXFW07tz1R,1554491068741259266,ANIME4LIFE,57996663,704833806067314688
