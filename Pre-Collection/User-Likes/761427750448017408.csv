Imo, these teams should fight to avoid relegation. If you ask me who will survive, I'd say UK with Latrell Davis should take the 13th place. Key players:
Latrell Davis(UK)
Teodor Simic(MKD)
Conrad Luczinsky(POL)
Amar Licina(MNE)

"I've enjoyed watching Cyril Martynov (6'11 C/F, UPlay Canada). He is a good passer for his size and he looks fairly comfortable with the ball in mid-post. Great touch and feel with size is a good.
