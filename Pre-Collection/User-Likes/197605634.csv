"Was crushed to hear on TBS broadcast about my former researcher at Fox, Aaron Charlton.  Such a good soul...so funny.   He would always say, ""Good one, Chris"" or more likely, ""not so funny there...good try"".  If you're so inclined, please help his family.

Aaron Charlton passed away today. I‚Äôm calling a baseball game because that‚Äôs what we do and what AC did with me for so long. He made the games so much better for so many for so long. An absolute gift to this world.  This hurts. Blessing to his beautiful family. https://t.co/wQuUlTsBSX,1448063634781847554,BAndersonPxP,838952552351821825,197605634
