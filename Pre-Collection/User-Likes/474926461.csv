"Our pals at @NorthstarHoops shared some thoughts on @Zach_Spann!  

""A 6’5 wing from EV and Minnesota Fury. Comparison – Jamil Jackson.  Similar frame, similar bounce off the floor, playing on a very good team. Why Zach? There is a lot of potential there!"" https://t.co/Cq7GO43ZoW https://t.co/KQTrNj4zkz",1251147180099821568,EVBoysHoops,3874846453,474926461

Jalen Green is the highest-ranked recruit to forego CBB for the professional ranks in the one-and-done era. 

Have to wonder what type of impact Green’s decision could have on other top recruits.
