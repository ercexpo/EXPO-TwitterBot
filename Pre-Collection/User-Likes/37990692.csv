@J_Fahringer @FlyersPucck That‚Äôs kind of my point. There should be no excuse to not go after him and I have no doubt he won‚Äôt be. He‚Äôs a bad GM and he‚Äôs getting worse.,1549869531669168128,FlyersPuckSauce,2378962568,37990692
@bradleyc4 They go down from 10 to 7 episodes since the writers were focused on their now cancelled Star Wars project. The source material still isn‚Äôt finished so they have the bullet points but none of the nuance that made the story compelling,1549844134424371203,CoopaLoop00,211690154,37990692
@bradleyc4 That line was severely underrated at the end of the season. Cates-frost-Tippett.,1549843313485926401,GFV_Philly,1498777554865594368,37990692
"@bradleyc4 @PhillyDemMPA @FlyersPuckSauce He might punch a guy in the face, but will they STAY punched?",1549841284520726529,jsaquella,15285457,37990692
@bradleyc4 @PhillyDemMPA Small sample size but sure looked like a darn solid 3rd liner to me. I could see them over-thinking we can‚Äôt have him with Frost and Tippett on 3rd line so he should get more minutes in the A. Seems like the type of player Torts would love too. Who really knows at this point.,1549839666546974721,FlyersPuckSauce,2378962568,37990692
@bradleyc4 I gotta give you credit for caring and trying to figure out what's best for the current team...The amount of apathy and disgust I have for them can't be calculated,1549839273238601730,SandisMinnesota,167083650,37990692
@bradleyc4 @FlyersPuckSauce I would say there is a 50/50 chance he's in Lehigh.,1549837922114981893,Trizellini,111158159,37990692
@bradleyc4 Oh that‚Äôs happening. There is no doubt.,1549835757367558145,FlyersPuckSauce,2378962568,37990692
