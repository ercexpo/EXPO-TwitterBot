@KPMcClave @paulynarciso @springsteen The Boss is doing irreparable harm to his once solid reputation as everymans' rocker. At least he'll be filthy stinking rich. Way to go Bruce. #Boycottspringsteen,1552222856666398720,rob_clayton1,240079046,63880844
"To say I'm gutted by that  response from Jon Landau is an understatement. All my frustration had been thrown at  @Ticketmaster and now I realize it should have been directed at both. Sorry, but $800-$5000 a ticket should NEVER be normal.   #SpringsteenTickets

"@KeithOlbermann @NBCNews @chucktodd @LesterHoltNBC The single biggest mistake journalists can make is to believe their stories have to have ""balance,"" as if that means hearing from the people telling the truth and hearing from people who lie, and then treating the two sides as equally valid.
