"Omar Little - Ryan Day

I was going back and forth but I don’t think it’s close. Ryan Day is just in his own world from everyone else, no muscle(boosters) he his own muscle getting work done with recruiting and developing QBs. https://t.co/7m8WwArMEn",1552090255230046208,Markmoney__,387424655,1216080488781139968
"Bodie- Herm Edwards 

Herm worked his ass off to try get Arizona state relevant. He was on a solid trajectory to do that like Bodie in the streets. However something’s went bad and now Herm just waiting for Chris and snoop to walk him down an alley with his tenure at ASU. 😔 https://t.co/MlQLerEC3w",1552085068893470720,Markmoney__,387424655,1216080488781139968

Cheese - Lincoln Riley 

Lincoln has been at the forefront of college football for quite sometime now, him going to USC gives him the GO to start a new journey to be THEE guy. He got that kind of cheese to be in the game. https://t.co/114r4IyePs",1552079598900219904,Markmoney__,387424655,1216080488781139968
"Bunk Moreland- Sam Pittman 

The peoples people. You can’t not like Coach Pittman he’s a guy you want to see win at all times. Old school in morals and values, wants to see nothing but success from his people  will go the extra mile to do so. https://t.co/CcoKxMvDVG",1552078003273957376,Markmoney__,387424655,1216080488781139968
"Prop Joe - Jimbo Fisher 

When Jimbo speaks a proposition may fall kindly on your ear. A lot of money is rumored (allegedly) to be placed around the A&amp;M program. Jimbo got the Co-Op on point it seems like. https://t.co/3GNPcOGsc2",1552075244420071425,Markmoney__,387424655,1216080488781139968

So I won’t go to much into detail.. IYKYK. Lane is can be creative enough to cause havoc in the system speaks his mind doesn’t really care how you feel. https://t.co/fJOQO7rlPg",1552073654359433219,Markmoney__,387424655,1216080488781139968
"Clay Davis - Deion Sanders 

The gift of gab at its finest. Deion reminds me of him so much without the shiesty. He can sell you a whale without the water and make you believe you can get the water without buying it. https://t.co/7grnh4Ldv9",1552071582268289024,Markmoney__,387424655,1216080488781139968
