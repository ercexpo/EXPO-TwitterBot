"If anyone ever complains about a twitch streamer swearing in their stream I have a little bit of advice for you.

Don't watch them.

If you're a parent who's not happy about what your child is watching, guess what, a twitch streamer is not a babysitter.",1501196646562111489,Doefacedttv,1495903102603571208,1353712623620141056

"@Doefacedttv @Momma_Sia you can transfer your nintendo account to a new switch, and all your digital purchases will be tied to the account, so you should be able to download them again and import your save data as well",1499763809837277186,AKAlovegames,890505570,1353712623620141056

"@Momma_Sia i can sympathize with this. When i get tilted i am not fun to be around, and i don't want that to cloud the stream vibe. Do what you think is best for your channel, and trust your gut.",1499149776377556998,PeglegpeteTTV,1285969485845987338,1353712623620141056
