"I'm getting annoyed with people saying Rust and Letang took ""less"" to stay here. They didn't. Their sum was just spread over a longer term. Letang would have made $9.15M AAV in a 4-year deal, Rust $7.65M. Malkin is apparently asking for $6M/4. 

It's not a huge ask in comparison.",1545997584388526080,kelsey_surmacz4,81921468,1187074625483751424
"The league average OPS heading into play today is .707. 8 of the 9 hitters in the Brewers' lineup are above that mark (McCutchen's .694).

The Pirates' lineup -- sans Bryan Reynolds (.812) -- has only 3 hitters above league average: Ben Gamel, Daniel Vogelbach and Jack Suwinski.",1545873819407089664,ChrisHalicke,493584153,1187074625483751424
NHL ELC/RFA system strikes again. Forsberg is one of the best players in the game and the system is set up so that he signs what will nevertheless end as a bad contract,1545783622908641285,ntrider825,37302286,1187074625483751424

Thanks for following along, interacting, and keeping me on my toes. Extra-large thanks to @eliteprospects for the platform, for the support, and for keeping me housed and fed in Montreal. 

I love this job.",1545504520410628105,Hockey_Robinson,4225614732,1187074625483751424
"No fourth line guy in the NHL, not one, keeps anyone off stars.

It‚Äôs just bad logic that no one can even defend when tested.

Your stars aren‚Äôt even on the ice at the same time and no one is afraid to do what they do and most shit is split second decisions anyways. https://t.co/6c8Rtr0oPn",1545504018327187456,GarretHohl,260790076,1187074625483751424
