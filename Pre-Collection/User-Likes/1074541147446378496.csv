@mcgrane_matt @JefePil @MarcB76743947 @TommyG105 @jokershawn37 @IamEliRacks I personally disagree but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre alone in that assessment. I do think Slayton does have issues tracking the deep ball though that plays into this play to some extent.,1546334140735410176,MONTECRI5TO,312957089,1074541147446378496
@mcgrane_matt @JefePil @MarcB76743947 @TommyG105 @jokershawn37 @IamEliRacks But again I don‚Äôt disagree the perception would of been better if he laid out. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always that is always the case.,1546332596522651649,MONTECRI5TO,312957089,1074541147446378496
@mcgrane_matt @JefePil @MarcB76743947 @TommyG105 @jokershawn37 @IamEliRacks For sure there definitely are situations where your best shot is to dive. I just think here he ran hard to try to get underneath it and in result was able to get his hands on it. At that point I don‚Äôt think you want to layout for it. Unfortunate he couldn‚Äôt bring it in.,1546332288333631489,MONTECRI5TO,312957089,1074541147446378496
