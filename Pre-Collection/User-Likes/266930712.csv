"@abaseballchick they had chance at catcher with good amount of potential and went for it. I don't like the move. Marsh improved on power this year and his defense is a plus. He needs to fix his approach &amp; add a little bit more power. I see his future: 20+ homers, 275 avg 20 SB, and GG at CF",1554562520462942209,omario949,1501407200450781184,266930712

"@abaseballchick Maybe it's a future rebuild move? 

Lol because you are 100% on point. 

Keeping cost control players, especially talented ones with lots of potential, is what a rebuild is supposed to be about.",1554561424206155776,OCSportsGeek,22081714,266930712
