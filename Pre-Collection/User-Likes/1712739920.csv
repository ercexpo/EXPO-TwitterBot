"“Last year, I wasn’t involved in Mania &amp; I’ll be honest, that deeply hurt. Deeply hurt.

The fact that I show up for every TV, every house show, every overseas tour, every media appearance. Then, to be left off 2 nights of WrestleMania, that hurt.”

"Reigns v Rollins (2016). 

One of Rollins' first match back after his knee injury.

Rollins goes for the sun-set flip. 

Watch how Reigns guides Rollins through the move. 

Keeping hold of his leg until he's fully safe to drop down.

Reigns is so good. https://t.co/Y1moBr7V6h",1554089569556934656,WrestleFeatures,1060908107541475330,1712739920
