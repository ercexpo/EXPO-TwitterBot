"ü•≥ Happy Birthday John Elway! In 1998, John became only the 2nd QB in NFL history to pass for 50K yards &amp; the 3rd to throw 300 TD's. Elway tied the NFL record for most 4Q Comebacks in a single season with 6 in 1985 &amp; also led the NFL that year in GWD's with 6!

"Today is a sad day for me. One of my Idols growing up, Marlin Briscoe, passed away. He was one of a few Black QBs of the late 60s that gave me the inspiration that one day I could play QB as a professional. Marlin was the 1st Black QB to start in the AFL.",1541597297804312577,WMoon1,183351664,1169435313418190848
"Well, you can pretty well guess. Black QB. Unconventional style. Pro football just wasn't ready for him. Here's a great stat: Marlin threw 3 TD passes in a game 3 times in that '68 season. The next #NFL/AFL rookie QB to do that was . . . Dan Marino with the '83 #Dolphins.",1541516325339660291,dandalyonsports,182895431,1169435313418190848
