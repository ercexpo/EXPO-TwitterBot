"Deven Marrero used to live with Eric Hosmer during the offseason before he signed with the #Padres.

I remember JD Martinez visiting them during that period as well.

Interesting connection there, depending how things play out the next few hours.

"I've seen this question a lot: ""Why are the Patriots not receiving draft compensation from the Dolphins for tampering with their starting quarterback? Doesn't past precedent indicate the Patriots should get something??""

The answer is actually quite simple: https://t.co/lt4WjLrYl7",1554544416496443393,michaelFhurley,113136762,836740546764877824
"Hosmer isn‚Äôt going to be some life changing piece, but he fills a black hole at 1B.

He‚Äôs been up and down at the plate in 2022, but has a 106 wRC+ in July and will give you competent defense at 1B. 

Still easy to deal this winter.
