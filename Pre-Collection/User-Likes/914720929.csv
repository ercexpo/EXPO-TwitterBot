@MilkyKulwicki @sreekyshooter To me it felt like there was actually some Jimmy left. This seemed more Slippin’ Jimmy than it did Saul Goodman,1552295428044910592,LilDinker4,1218190647225536513,914720929
"@sreekyshooter The people who hated this episode, are probably the same ones who’ve been asking for an entire gene episode and are just made Walt and Jesse didn’t show up. 

I loved this episode. It showed there’s still some Saul left.",1552268121033117696,MilkyKulwicki,1445052714254274561,914720929
@sreekyshooter It was a great episode.  Gene/Saul did what he did because that person recognized him so now that the dude stole all of that stuff Saul was able to blackmail him.  He is taking care of everything without running away.,1552259985358594048,GMen38,1856014512,914720929
@sreekyshooter A Cinnabon @Cinnabon montage mixed with great acting from the legendary Carol Burnett @CarolBurnett3 and an intricate con from Gene channeling Saul &amp; Jimmy that was so fun to watch! The whole episode was literally delicious!! #BetterCallSaul,1552218289991999494,jberlau,286485142,914720929
"@loc12313 @sreekyshooter I enjoyed that hour you called a waste. It was a light hearted return to form for Jimmy/Saul/Gene and it's clear that we're not done with Gene's timeline

I hope the rest of the show is all Gene timeline with one flashback for the obligatory Jesse/Walt cameo you're salivating for",1552035585040101376,TellahAsa,216949479,914720929

"@kylegriffin1 @DrDinD @NBCNews So anybody else notice that Biden ain’t playing anymore? Yesterday was a pivot, or as many observed - Dad pulled over the car and turned it around.  Enough with the malarkey in the back seat!",1436326894627033097,VintageJoyFinds,15181002,914720929
