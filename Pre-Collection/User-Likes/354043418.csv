"@bandz81 @krishcoughran @NickCRadio I‚Äôm excited for those things.  And I really want to see 2 of Sabonis, Richaun, and Murray a lot.  Maybe even all 3 with Fox and Monk.  Make a team that can do a lot of things. Warriors shifted their strategy round by round.",1552118798987055104,Bmutch,19923786,354043418
@Bmutch @krishcoughran @NickCRadio Still have fox sabonis and Barnes. Davion expected to make a jump. TD is back. Added monk and huerter who are shooters and will put up pts. Holmes will be back better hopefully lol. Keegan will get his double digits I just don‚Äôt think 18 pts.,1552114787533725696,bandz81,1400486413427101701,354043418
