"Anna Hall of @GatorsTF has 5741 points going into her last (and best) heptathlon event, the 800m. If she runs her PR of 2:03.11 seconds, she will score 6809 points! That would make her the 19th best heptathlete in World History at just 21 years old! 🐊🐊",1549103754854686721,asiacymone14,1885197090,887764616742416384
