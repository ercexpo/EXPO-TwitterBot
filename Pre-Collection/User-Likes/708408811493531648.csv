@SanditonH @miss_heywoods You’re right. Everyone has their preferences for sure. Northanger is darker in tone than her other novels so S1 isn’t a complete departure from anything Austen.

@Augustasoldhat @miss_heywoods @HoggStanDan I do like Jeremy Northam’s Knightley. He did a good job. 🥰,1554191474962612225,RachelXanderFan,1531542126588305409,708408811493531648

"@Tinfoil_Bonnet @RachelXanderFan @HoggStanDan @miss_heywoods I noticed how they changed what Wentworth says in the new Persuasion. He doesn’t say any woman from 15-30, but 18-80, upping the age and in a jokey way. But it would have been normal for a man nearing 40 to marry a 16 year old. No care whether she’d like it, of course.",1554188871834927104,TheScribblerCMB,972240416325107717,708408811493531648

@Tinfoil_Bonnet @HoggStanDan @miss_heywoods Right. Lol. Just have to remind yourself it was totally normal for the time. Jonny Lee Miller was 10 years older than Romola Garai when they did Emma and it didn’t seem gross to me.,1554186427570823173,RachelXanderFan,1531542126588305409,708408811493531648

"@RachelXanderFan @HoggStanDan @miss_heywoods I just checked, she was 4 years older than the character of Emma at the time.

"@HoggStanDan @Tinfoil_Bonnet @miss_heywoods Agree. Lots of men in their 30s or older married 18 year old girls. It can be done. It just takes the right casting, I think.

"@Tinfoil_Bonnet @HoggStanDan @miss_heywoods Ha! You’re onto something. The way they styled him made him seem younger to me but she also felt older than Emma’s real age so that was probably part of it like you said.

"@RachelXanderFan @HoggStanDan @miss_heywoods Johnny Flynn was 37 when that came out, so he’s exactly the right age. Perhaps Anya Taylor-Joy was a bit too old then.

I’m watching Jane Eyre 2006 for the first time. I LOVE this story. I love Jane. I love that she knows her value and worth even though no one else ever did except for Helen. I love that she respects herself. The proposal is everything because Jane loves herself first. #JaneEyre,1554162957986185216,LeetteRuthieEW,58470913,708408811493531648
