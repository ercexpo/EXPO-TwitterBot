"@BinkleyHoops Stockton’s 3. That was really the last season of Hakeem’s prime and if somehow they pull off a miracle in game 7 on the road, Rockets fans get the MJ finals dream matchup.",1552336700004769792,JonathanHernon,2326177789,964288810820419584

@BinkleyHoops Yao Ming breaking his foot! Lakers had no answer for him and with Artest and that strong supporting cast they would have defeated the Magic.,1552332598382399489,TVerse82,109741821,964288810820419584
"@BinkleyHoops I think it’s tough. I saw @BenDuBose response and have no problem with it. 2009 with Yao could’ve won a title for sure. 96-97 was the last really good Barkley year in his career though. I think if they survived game 6 at home, going to Utah with Olajuwon, Drexler, and Elie? Cmon",1552331020850135044,mightguyslegacy,243225940,964288810820419584

"@BenDuBose @BinkleyHoops Yes, agreed on Yao.  And good call on the 1997 Rockets.  Even if that shot misses, the Rockets were only a 30% to win that series at that point.    

But mainly, I'm still looking for the Chris Paul injury picture.",1552324247711846401,AustinCory,32792649,964288810820419584
