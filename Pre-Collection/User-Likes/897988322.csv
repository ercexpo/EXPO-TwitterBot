@RawBeautyKristi I don't understand nasty comments either. If for whatever reason you don't fancy someone online just don't say anything! It's so much easier to just click off and continue living. Negativity never benefited anyone!! Love you girl! Keep being you! 🤗💕,1115774743435718656,GwendolynC_,808767804375760898,897988322
