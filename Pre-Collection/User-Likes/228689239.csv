@intuLakeside just wanted to thank the intu lakeside staff - my mum put her phone on a tray after eating and put it in the bin. The staff were very very helpful in searching for the phone and getting bin bags out for a good 20 minutes to try and find the phone 👍🏼,1209070232125476864,StefanKingg,240854121,228689239
