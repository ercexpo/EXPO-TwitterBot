@JosephGillMA All about how he defends a 4 for those 20 mins. His role isn‚Äôt m changing offensively.,1542972855369039872,AlecKinsky,174734704,2879240111
@JosephGillMA Yeah but you know u offset that with Rudy help and KAT help for a Rudy PnR. Nothing is ever ideal but hey it worked for Dirk,1542972038939156480,ItsKingsBruh,1183952233777389568,2879240111
We gotta hedge and show. They can hunt him at the 4 but with the PnR but thats a less of a roll threat generally speaking. They finna have to hit jumpers https://t.co/5MmsvUmISF,1542971417699819520,ItsKingsBruh,1183952233777389568,2879240111
