Once I get home tonight I read the entire 16 page document. Until then I'm not commenting further or predicting if the NFL will appeal or not. I want to have time to look at the whole ruling and justification #Browns,1554156853172375552,roachizm13,298045073,843260443519016960

"People comparing Ridley's 17 game suspension to Watson just isn't the same thing. The NFL cannot afford to let players begin to gamble on games, derail the integrity of the league &amp; let conspiracy theories of fixing games gain legs.

I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear it. Jacoby will be your starting QB for 6 weeks. This is exactly why they went out and got him in FA. He will be fine! #Browns have no reason to go get Cam Newton or Jimmy G now. https://t.co/I8LTDFQVfb,1554088104746704897,ZachNoah52,377640347,843260443519016960
