@raise_athlete @Wielo14 @Patrick_Reusse To say New Ulm doesn't support town baseball is far from the truth. Improvements made to the ballparks at Johnson AND Mueller diamonds show the great support. MBA should reconsider. Long time MBA board members resigned over issue of even having State so they know the struggle.,1287861573395066880,StCarl5,2887992737,2646508997

I hope all Amateur baseball players take this serious enough that if you have had a COVID-19 test that you are smart enough to stay away from the field until you get the results back saying negative.  @MinnBaseball https://t.co/kAWIkFlddI,1274472654972637184,JasonChalupsky9,294975998,2646508997
