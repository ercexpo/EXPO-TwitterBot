"Yes, the Jazz have had interest in New York‚Äôs RJ Barrett. No, the Knicks shouldn‚Äôt include Barrett in a trade for Utah‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell, in my opinion. Knicks have ample draft capital, should be able to get a deal done without including Barrett: https://t.co/yYr2Z6T0Lj",1553125774441562115,IanBegley,164076105,260876522
@BenRitholtzNBA If he's willing to accept less than the max then that would be quite nice,1553120889322995712,TheCohencidence,31425885,260876522
"RJ is repped by Bill Duffy. Duffy reps Deandre Ayton. Ayton held out for a max and found a team willing to offer one. 

Hindsight is 20/20, and I get why they waited, but the Suns should've maxed Ayton in October.

Knicks would be wise to avoid a similar situation from unfolding",1553120173611163650,TheCohencidence,31425885,260876522
"Second contracts are more about projections than they are about past performance. 

RJ's body of work has not been worthy of a max. If he holds out for a max deal, he'll get one when he hits free agency. So there's a strong argument to max him now and show he's wanted long term",1553119496289894405,TheCohencidence,31425885,260876522
"If there's a belief within the FO that RJ will reach his potential, the Knicks should max RJ

If the Knicks think another team would max RJ as a RFA, the Knicks should max RJ

If any contract signed now seems small in 2025 when the salary cap spikes, the Knicks should max RJ https://t.co/gYXEZRh8KZ",1553119113400270848,TheCohencidence,31425885,260876522

"@rafaelshimunov @StopAntisemites Why did you put this on your credit card first instead of raising the money first?
Do you intend to pay donors back if this attempt fails?
What will happen if the price goes up past what you've raised, will you put more on your credit card?",1553111920139505664,MisfitTorah,856906205842870273,260876522
