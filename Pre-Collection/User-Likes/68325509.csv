@desmondalan Here are some of the accomplishments thus far. It's not all about you. I am very proud of our president. Canceling debt is a massive logistical and economic process. Just bc he hasn't done it yet doesn't mean he won't. https://t.co/JYXZGl2ibP,1554151549693300738,Andie00471,1233523757249159173,68325509
@Solja42 @desmondalan You are this person? I hope you give that some thought. We are very close to winning the Senate. People not voting in 2016 gave us Trump. You might not ever see another democratic election if we lose both. https://t.co/nFJHNEMYNZ,1554148681280094213,Andie00471,1233523757249159173,68325509
