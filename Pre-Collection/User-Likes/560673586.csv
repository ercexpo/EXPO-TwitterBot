“Nope, I don’t care. He won’t pitch until he learns to run cross country.”

Yes, that’s how stupid some of you sound with your conditioning tests",1553508300876136454,Challenger_ST,218687675,560673586

"@SALES_720 I figured giving him ice, wrap it and telling him to check in with his school athletic trainer, was better than telling him the vasoconstriction of the muscles may delay the inflammatory response and may delay your recovery but yet you will still be in a ton of pain without it.",1553496591977299969,ODUFbATC,768459343025074176,560673586
@ODUFbATC @zackkuntz_717 “De-icing” is just the latest iteration of series of fads that will eventually swing back toward a middle ground…IMO,1553489710626078722,CieslakDr,1219392332942008320,560673586

@mnhopper1s @SchneidKyle @ATCanonymous Thankfully instructor cost falls into our programs budget. We are certifying a new cohort every year plus preceptors PRN.,1553444889446187008,DrGililland,749417158527029248,560673586
"I gave someone ice at a high school camp today after he strained his posterior tib, I hope the #ATtwitter world doesn’t scold me and blacklist me forever.",1553444755895422977,ODUFbATC,768459343025074176,560673586
@mnhopper1s @DrGililland @ATCanonymous I only pay $100 every 2 years to maintain. I’ve started charging enough per certification to cover my costs of supplies and my recert,1553443756099227652,SchneidKyle,490974992,560673586
"@mnhopper1s I actually struggled more with vb, as our gyms constantly had ac issues. So add the 100+ degree heat to the increasing humidity in a gym was not good for anyone lol That’s when I actually enjoyed being outside!",1553443467186958336,Lauren_HoytATC,603325724,560673586
"@mnhopper1s I was used to the heat per se. But working as much as a single AT does during a fb practice was always an adjustment for me. Being there for weights and conditioning, all through July, was much different than actual practices come august.",1553443212836028417,Lauren_HoytATC,603325724,560673586
"@mnhopper1s I feel like I’m good at hydrating in the moment, but preparing was something I had to learn. Those first days of practice were often accompanied by a headache at the end of the day, due to increased sweat loss.",1553441951151562753,Lauren_HoytATC,603325724,560673586
@DrGililland @mnhopper1s @ATCanonymous I agree. Main reason I switched to AHA. But our training center’s mission is to certify as many people as possible. I consistently do classes with 1-2 people and no one complains,1553441352477720577,SchneidKyle,490974992,560673586
