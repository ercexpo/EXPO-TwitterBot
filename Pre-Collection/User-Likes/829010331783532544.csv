"On this #MemorialDay I love to share this video. 

French caretakers take the sand from Omaha Beach in Normandy and scrub them into the letters to give them the brown/gold coloring. 

They do this for all 9,386 soldiers who died.

France also gave us this land as American soil. https://t.co/b86AOmLMaR",1531324566307450880,DannyDeraney,18309553,829010331783532544
