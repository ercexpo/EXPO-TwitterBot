I'm diggin' Montgomery and Quintana in the rotation. #STLCards,1554588624938844162,Turn2Dude,2442373225,28853819
Kinda like this deal. With Carlson showing he can man CF and he’s way younger than Bader we have the depth to either call someone up and put them in RF or just put Yepez there. Montgomery is a solid pitcher too! #STLCards,1554588212231901187,K1NGCART3R,2517629265,28853819
