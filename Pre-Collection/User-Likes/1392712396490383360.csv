Let this sink in for a minute. This isn't how he feels because his marriage is falling apart... this has BEEN his life. He was taking antidepressants before Blitz came into the picture. He's been depressed for a LONG fuckin time. https://t.co/mgbFdoGiiX,1553562223225741317,Deeda514,1495595169986625538,1392712396490383360
