"Arms matter in sprinting, and in fact the spread of data from the recent study demonstrated that some sprinters benefit more than the 1.6% stated. The superior trap &amp; bicep do enable pelvic drive, but don‚Äôt expect the best bench pressing athletes to have the fastest sprint times. https://t.co/83uY5nIIkO",1504795860407889927,spikesonly,3294192069,1902368341
"JUMP THEMES &amp; PROGRESSIONS

We categorize all of our jumps into 3 categories.

- Strength (weighted, full depth, box drop)
- Power (reactive, half depth, Accel, lightly weighted)
- Speed (reactive, 1/4 depth, Accel)

Here is progression of our box drop series to fit zones 1 &amp; 2 https://t.co/BvqSutZ42X",1504640342863360014,bigk28,608608687,1902368341

"Old school warm up:

üö´Slow full field Lap/jog
üö´Fast to slow dynamics
üö´Stretching circle

Simple tweaks:

‚úÖSkip the lap. Do 2- mobility drills + 2 activation drills (less time than a lap!)
‚úÖSlow to fast dynamic
‚úÖSkips/Bounds/jumps
‚úÖEnd dynamic with 2-3 10 yard sprint",1503907915501121542,JoeAratari,380089327,1902368341
"THE PUSH PRESS

One of the easiest Oly lift (the jerk) variations to teach your athletes.

Big bank for your buck as it:

- Teaches synchronization between lower &amp; upper body
- Force output similar to the clean
- Easy transition to push/split jerk
