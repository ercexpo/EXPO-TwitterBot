@Ryan_823 @WalterMaselli1 Honestly I think trading Mancini says nothing about the “state” of the rebuild.  He’s a guy that no longer had a role on the team and was going to walk as a free agent anyway at the end of the season.

@DistrictOrioles It is a very difficult place to hit.    Beautiful stadium.   By far the most fan friendly but not the best dimensions or batter’s eye,1547950658455683078,AlexS1898,887136330261696512,1112122469035528192
@DistrictOrioles Aberdeen seems stifle offense but it’s also a big jump from A to A+ - see how mightily Gunnar struggled when first promoted to A+. Cowser/Norby didn’t have huge home/away splits there. Mayo hit much worse on the road in A+. Prieto had more HRs. Cowser had good #s last month in A+,1547949789198708749,OsFanTherapy,1408863074585563143,1112122469035528192

@DistrictOrioles Yep but at least I get both teams on cable. I was able to watch all of the Royals series and actually went to one of the Cardinals games. I never get Cubs or White Sox games unless they’re playing one of those two teams so it makes the blackout for Chicago teams weird,1547390975445798916,Ryan_823,869118691480182784,1112122469035528192
@DistrictOrioles Thank you. I’m stuck under a blackout restriction anytime we play a Chicago team despite living in Missouri. It’s frustrating,1547389362484219906,Ryan_823,869118691480182784,1112122469035528192
