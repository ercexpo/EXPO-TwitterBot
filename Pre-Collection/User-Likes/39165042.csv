My personal account has come close to being shut down numerous times -- even as recently as last week -- b/c I borrow against it to pay freelancers what I can b/c one of my own freelance gigs never pays on time. (6/8),1553794151271088128,Fulanigrl,47118147,39165042
"I didn't think 10 years later, I'd be living at my parents house as a 41-year-old (I've been here for 8 years) and working three side jobs to barely be able to pay my own personal bills, let alone freelancers, the printer, shipping, etc. (5/8)",1553794149111021568,Fulanigrl,47118147,39165042
"I left LS 9 years ago to do the mag full time b/c I felt I couldn't grow it to what it is now if I didn't leave. I knew it would be hard, but I thought with more time to work on the mag, I'd be able to secure advertising partnerships and fund the mag and grow it.

"You know, how people always say there's no perfect time, you just start. I've had the idea for Sesi since I was 17. Before launching, I was a high school English teacher for 5 years, and then, I worked as an editor at LivingSocial. In both jobs, I just made enough to live.

"First, I would never expect/ask anyone to donate who can't afford to. I know it's hard out here. 

Secondly, It's not that I can ""afford"" to run a business. I've never had the funding needed, but I stepped out on faith 10 years ago. (2/8)",1553794141879816197,Fulanigrl,47118147,39165042
