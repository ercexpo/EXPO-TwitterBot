"@seanhackbarth @shakey12381 @SiaNejad Absolutely agree with you that it’s key and undercovered! Something I’m still working on after 9 years 😬

Loved their podcast covering those topics too!",1553861210994532352,megs08DFS,1230365928006864898,4309774966
@megs08DFS @shakey12381 @SiaNejad So I will eat up all the content on bankroll management and contest selection. Unsexy but undercovered.,1553857553163075587,seanhackbarth,11246242,4309774966
"@megs08DFS @shakey12381 @SiaNejad I’ve added my deposit for the season. Have my weekly allocation determined. Now, need to decide how I’ll spend it. Sia’s podcast w/ Stix helped. Unless I bink early I will be very disciplined… in theory.",1553855519462408197,seanhackbarth,11246242,4309774966
"Tony Finau’s Sunday Scoring has been FINAU-momal! 

-Last 6 Sunday Rounds:
67-66-69-64-67-68

-12/16 Sunday rounds this year have been in the 60’s

He’s -4 so far today and he’s changing his nickname from “Top-10 Tony” to “Floodgates Finau”

Sunday Scoring has been a huge part",1553850003994644480,therealGFD,461220810,4309774966

"Can Cam Young get it done from 4 shots back and pay our 18-1 off? 

Or will rookie Pendrith get his first win? (already paying our t20 at +300 💰💰)

Or will Tony go back to back (guess I should add him)?
