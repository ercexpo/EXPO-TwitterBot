"A lot of college players/coaches talk about getting drafted as though it's the end goal.

But it shouldn't be.

The ones who make it to the MLB aren't just content to be getting ""their shot"" but actually get hungrier &amp; refocus.

The draft is a checkpoint to the destination.‚úàÔ∏è",1414563084996419589,TreadAthletics,3003888903,764085938
