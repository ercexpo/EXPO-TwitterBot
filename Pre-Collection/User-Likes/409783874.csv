Thanks #k12artchat and @MrCCrespo @MsValentineRMS  and @josephboatfield for these great questions! I was super late but enjoyed doing some reflecting and being inspired by others! #togetherweARTbetter https://t.co/Nma4ogPATK,1545264677491544064,dewestudio,38874524,409783874

"A6 Instagram &amp; Twitter are great tools for finding artists but technology evolves regularly &amp; I still find local #arts organizations tend to be more fulfilling in making connections than most digital tools, #art is everywhere &amp; with it like minded creatives! #K12ArtChat https://t.co/q60X1035OD",1545230398250258432,timneedles,15124927,409783874
@Artguy76 I need lots of processing time. SO writing or images or layers of media like @GrundlerArt does... it's just thinking through and codifying my thoughts. #k12artchat,1545228742968184834,conniedraws,547297510,409783874
Hey #K12ArtChat I‚Äôm a HS #art &amp; m did teacher &amp; author of the book #STEAM Power just settling in after a week of #ISTELive joining in late! https://t.co/yRydeUmdgt,1545228099389984770,timneedles,15124927,409783874

"@GrundlerArt I'm curious, what medium is ""your"" medium? Mine is more design/illustration so it is hard to share that with my students because it is not the ""frame and hang on a gallery wall"" kind of work. Does that make sense?",1545226444644786180,AAEAtweets,412771418,409783874
@AAEAtweets Totally- that why I mostly keep a visual journal just so I‚Äôm doing a little something each day- I think we are hard on ourselves thinking we need to create a body of work or big things- for me it‚Äôs just a little gesture or collage in my book #K12ArtChat,1545225675816181761,GrundlerArt,2792213864,409783874
@creativitydept @SchoolArts #K12ArtChat A5: getting Arted out is real. There‚Äôs days after talking about it all day I simply can‚Äôt get myself to do some for myself. Summer time is a great time to explore my own interests again ‚òÄÔ∏è,1545225647961870336,josephboatfield,3145161553,409783874
#k12artchat if I gave it a number I‚Äôd say 20-30% of the teachers I lead also practice and share their craft in some way. I‚Äôm constantly amazed by what I see @GrundlerArt creating. Some days im@lucky if I can throw together a quick image. https://t.co/oxYmE7UDNq https://t.co/Ro5c7kFT1R,1545225628361932800,artcombobulated,1242564942,409783874
"A3: Unfortunately not. I wish more of my circle created art. 

Perhaps we need teacher art trading cards! @Artguy76 üòâ

"A2: if you‚Äôve got it, flaunt it. At the very least it is a conversation starter. Any educator who practices what the teach is a bonus. #k12artchat https://t.co/p4QKQwKvZp https://t.co/vbdhdboO8B",1545224075722776582,artcombobulated,1242564942,409783874
@GrundlerArt I wonder how many history teachers do scholarship in their field. Or pick any other teacher field... I guess we're more of a performance based discipline... but sometimes it feels like extra pressure. #k12artchat,1545224065538990081,conniedraws,547297510,409783874
