4/4: Wasn‚Äôt playing the best at the beginning lol. Happy my family didn‚Äôt get a chance to make it due to the weather but man I‚Äôm glad they only heard things that was said through TV. All aside I had a great time! Some fans just need to get over that I didn‚Äôt pick their school.,1497281539700408324,EasyE2432,3237334315,965054393413496832
"3/4: If you hate me for that, I don‚Äôt know what to say. Makes me wonder how some of y‚Äôall treat others. Y‚Äôall can‚Äôt take me out my element. Love me some good trash talk, and the chants ‚ÄúEJ Sucks‚Äù cause at the time I was 0/3.",1497281461032042520,EasyE2432,3237334315,965054393413496832
2/4: But I can‚Äôt even explain how rude and disrespectful some fans were. Know your place. I have no hard feelings with that university but man y‚Äôall are crazy as hell if you think you can just talk to an athlete any kind of way. I play basketball everyday with a smile on my face.,1497281288046186497,EasyE2432,3237334315,965054393413496832
"1/4: Was too late to tweet something out after the game yesterday but man did I have a great time! Got to see my best friend, some family, and a lot of fans of mine from home. Great environment I loved the boos and the chants, they made me feel special.",1497281164821901327,EasyE2432,3237334315,965054393413496832
