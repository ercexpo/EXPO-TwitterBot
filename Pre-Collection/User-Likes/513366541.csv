This season we had several players quit 4 different reasons. No hard feelings from me. Ppl have to choose what fits them. Doesn't mean we will EVER lower the standard to keep a kid. The truth is any 1 can be replaced. Sometimes ppl dont figure that out until college or real world,1549229897201197057,MWTakeover,4046560995,513366541
"As I read post from Club Coaches. When you choose a club team make sure basketball isn't the #1 option. Any 1 can assemble talented kids. What &amp; who will they be around means a great deal. In a 🌎 of pedophiles, fighting refs &amp; coaches.Please choose development on &amp; off the floor",1549228628097089538,MWTakeover,4046560995,513366541
Sometimes you have to just let your kids imagine the game in their own environment. It builds for greater moments down the line. I let my daughter just shoot by herself in the driveway without intervening so she can build her own scenarios of the game. #girldad https://t.co/9kxnRFn4Yk,1549195496044085253,RP3natural,51943235,513366541

Recruits. What separates good from great as a player is pace. Do you have a motor already built in? With work a motor can be improved but if you’re not working out with pace you are literally practicing NOT having one.,1548733967087681537,CoachFrese,187039974,513366541

☀️Hello JULY: Hoopers Keep Grinding. You are the right fit for the right program.
