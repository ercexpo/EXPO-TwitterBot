"@IZigger77 You're not making any sense. Russell Westbrook is a supremely negative asset on that contract. If the Lakers could get Buddy and Turner and send nothing back, then sure, maybe one unprotected pick is enough. But making Russ the salary matching tool increases the price.",1550629707456053248,MasonGinsberg,36193803,1421474150519083008
@dalton_trigg I mean you're talking to a guy who pulls for the team that owns their unprotected pick in either 2024 or 2025 so yes I'm certainly with you on that lol,1550629026749890561,MasonGinsberg,36193803,1421474150519083008
@IZigger77 It should cost a first round pick JUST to dump Westbrook. So one additional pick for Buddy and Myles seems perfectly reasonable to me.,1550628784990294020,MasonGinsberg,36193803,1421474150519083008
The thing that tips the scale is the fact that LeBron is 37 &amp; the Lakers have to maximize right now. I don't see a better way for them to make the roster meaningfully better for the upcoming season than in a deal with a team like the Pacers that can absorb that Westbrook deal.,1550628276816822273,MasonGinsberg,36193803,1421474150519083008
Russ and two firsts for Buddy and Myles would be a great trade for the Lakers and LeBron should just tell them the only way he will consider re-signing is if they make the move. https://t.co/huu01Qej95,1550627460835852291,MasonGinsberg,36193803,1421474150519083008

"@churchwell22 i think that's totally fair. my point was the pacers asking for two under the circumstances isn't an upcharge. it's just the market for taking on russ *and* sending back two useful players, one of whom, in MT, is absurdly good.",1550616742266822657,danfavale,33127006,1421474150519083008

@SamQuinnCBS The price of dumping Russ alone should be a 1st tbh. Using another one to get Hield and Turner seems like a completely reasonable ask for the Pacers?,1550598768185282561,btoporek,102449871,1421474150519083008
@LakerTalks @YoFrontalOff @KolsonJ2022 i meaaan reasonable minds can disagree on how good the players are but myles turner is absolutely someone you should want/be comfortable with as your third-best player. the appeal of him and hield appreciably transcends the barren state of the lakers' supporting cast.,1550598591558914049,danfavale,33127006,1421474150519083008
