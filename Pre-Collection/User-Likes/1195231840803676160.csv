We were so happy to have a Black female lead on TV that we “almost” forgot that Olivia was in love with a white Republican. 😂😂,1553875701199245313,KirkWrites79,23223046,1195231840803676160
"The “Scandal” era was amazing. I feel like that was the first show that got Black Twitter watching TV at the same time. Y’all — Olivia, Fitz, Mellie had us all in chokehold. They timeline used to be chaos. 😂",1553874750203744258,KirkWrites79,23223046,1195231840803676160
"@maximusmom13 She ain’t lying about that “Black Girl Sunscreen”. Im a guy and I be using that shit daily. It’s fragrance free, reef safe, and no white cast. Salute to the Queen! #bb24 #bigbrother24 #taylorgang",1553867277476384768,datboi_twright,179585543,1195231840803676160
"@JaniB27 @bbeviction_ Some of these houseguests need to repeat kindergarten because they clearly missed the “apologize when your hurt people, even if it’s unintentionally” lesson.",1553860648483708930,pdbb4lyfe,1244524585,1195231840803676160

@bbeviction_ She deleted the video because it wasn’t hitting the way she thought it would. LOL girl bye Paloma really needs people around her to tell her to not post anything and stay off social media. The receipts are there girl,1553857787247173634,LuulaaY_O,337309141,1195231840803676160
Paloma deleted the tik tok LMFAOOO I don’t know what she thought was gonna happen but #bb24,1553857695156944899,bbeviction_,1288130746935320576,1195231840803676160

@bbeviction_ She's a narcissist. That's what they do. It isn't shocking in the least. Best thing we can do as a community is ignore her,1553849632614129665,Alpha_Feet_4U,1540766413349982208,1195231840803676160
@bbeviction_ She still claims they edited it badly but won’t take ownership what could not be edited on LIVE feeds,1553845738811150338,magicnmbr7,30593621,1195231840803676160

@bbeviction_ she’s so ridiculous 💀 she just needs to apologize and move on,1553841854965235714,grapejuiceIvr,3296861729,1195231840803676160
@bbeviction_ I just saw it and now I’m infuriated.  I am so sick of people who say “my truth”.  There is only THE truth and blaming Taylor or people on Twitter isn’t going to change a damn thing we saw on the feeds.  #BB24,1553841553369710593,JaniB27,1481088813690671111,1195231840803676160
