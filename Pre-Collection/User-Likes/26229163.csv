@TeamHandball I remember when Iceland played USA in the 95 World Cup at home. It was apparent that the US lacked some things (maybe many things) but the drive was there. Hopefully the sport will manage to grow in the States. Would be great for Handball.,1531405329006723072,Nyjahollstrax,2515070636,26229163

@TeamHandball Really interesting read. It's interesting to focus on one small area. The hotspots could be sport driven high schools (implement handball academy's in those schools). Also educate basketball players about playing this sport.,1531404125702856704,Nyjahollstrax,2515070636,26229163
