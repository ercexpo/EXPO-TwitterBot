"@ThomasHallNFL I agree. It's all too easy to jump on any if the host of stories from OTAs + early camp days, but Griffith seems to have picked up where he left off. It's encouraging",1553056509780578304,DocBearOMD,148002023,2958539051

@Tyler_Polumbus My rookie year I remember coach Reeves asking Joe Collier to take me off of the scout team defense because I was defeating blocks and messing up the offense's drill.  Maybe Josh should focus on the lack of blocking and the good containment by his pass rusher.,1553031793879629826,KarlMecklenburg,81135640,2958539051

"@ThomasHallNFL Loved hearing about Griffith's impressive day today. The decision to not emphasize ILB in the FA and draft periods has borne good fruit. 

Surtain and Simmons lead a stellar secondary. If they can get quality reps from Sterns and Ojemudia, they could be golden",1552905495211454464,DocBearOMD,148002023,2958539051
