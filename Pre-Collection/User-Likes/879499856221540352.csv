"Very, very high level tennis from Sinner. When he is good, he is so good. About to become the first player to beat Alcaraz from a set down in 2022.",1553840417812119554,josemorgado,44488467,879499856221540352
"On how many of Alcaraz‚Äôs 9 BP chances has he just missed the return?!

Has to be at least half, right?! Puzzling stuff, but credit to Sinner for plugging away. Leads 2-1* in the deciding set",1553837809378762756,AlGruskin,884987681280839680,879499856221540352
"Bit of a blink from Alcaraz hands the first break of the match to Sinner. Sinner now leads 2*-1 in the second set

Not an ounce of quit in either of these young stars. Wondering if the difference might be the slightly pro-Sinner crowd (which has been excellent all week in Umag)",1553828136432836609,AlGruskin,884987681280839680,879499856221540352
"What a hold from Sinner for 1-1

Found big serves to fight off multiple BPs + has stayed impressively positive with his body language. To clinch the game on a drop shot was a nice cherry on top as well",1553826237444915203,AlGruskin,884987681280839680,879499856221540352

76(5) first set to Alcaraz in the Umag final. Sinner‚Äôs been more than capable of handling Alcaraz‚Äôs pace. Has done an excellent job finding his BH too. That said, Alcaraz gonna Alcaraz",1553821516026056707,AlGruskin,884987681280839680,879499856221540352
