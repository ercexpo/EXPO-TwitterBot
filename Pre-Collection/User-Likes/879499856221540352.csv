"Bit of a blink from Alcaraz hands the first break of the match to Sinner. Sinner now leads 2*-1 in the second set

Not an ounce of quit in either of these young stars. Wondering if the difference might be the slightly pro-Sinner crowd (which has been excellent all week in Umag)",1553828136432836609,AlGruskin,884987681280839680,879499856221540352

Found big serves to fight off multiple BPs + has stayed impressively positive with his body language. To clinch the game on a drop shot was a nice cherry on top as well",1553826237444915203,AlGruskin,884987681280839680,879499856221540352

76(5) first set to Alcaraz in the Umag final. Sinner’s been more than capable of handling Alcaraz’s pace. Has done an excellent job finding his BH too. That said, Alcaraz gonna Alcaraz",1553821516026056707,AlGruskin,884987681280839680,879499856221540352
