"I've been married for a good long time. It's easy to let yourself fall into resentment which leads to hatred.

It's far more difficult to negotiate in love for the things you need while also giving them the things they need. You have to give and take and be grateful they give. https://t.co/70NiflP4VQ",1554449562302947330,libmomwhothinks,743422018339540992,1287207249337659392

"I don’t quite know how it happened, but I have an 18 year old now. He’s a wonderful young man. I know I have to let go soon, but I feel a bit greedy with the time I have left with him at home.",1554443206867263490,nogooddeed2,927621117535277056,1287207249337659392
"Love is not necessarily warm and fuzzy. To love a child is to act in the child’s best interest. Discipline, therefore, is love. Expecting a child to do chores around the home is love. Not giving a child a lot of material things is love. #parenting #parentguru",1554437136715227136,JohnKRosemond,351160380,1287207249337659392
