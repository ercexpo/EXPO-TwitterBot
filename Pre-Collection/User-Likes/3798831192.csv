July is anniversary month….I came back to my PhD alma mater to serve as IANR Vice Chancellor and NU Vice President in July 2010.  Last July I was very excited to name Trev Alberts as Vice Chancellor and Director of Athletics.  Happy 1st anniversary to the best AD in the biz! https://t.co/OY0t4KZmkz,1553508721996750848,RonnieDGreen,974583805,3798831192
