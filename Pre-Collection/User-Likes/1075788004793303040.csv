I'm so inclined to buy an imported Untold Tales of Spider-Man omnibus but if they release it in my country I'm gonna be pissed https://t.co/JPRqtFbJbP,1552043816999321601,comixjeff,1483825033013305346,1075788004793303040

@DDKeyD No sales chart for a while but it sold enough to get a sequel so I'd guess it sold high 50s to low 60s on launch and settled to high 40s to low 50s which is grand these days,1552030688181878790,glenn_matchett,524622258,1075788004793303040
