@skennedy88 @hgomez27 @dcsportsking Luckily many people stood by Hector and us.,1548499103893446656,TalkNats,3433301056,45752511
@TalkNats @hgomez27 @dcsportsking Proud to be in the ‚Äúnever doubted H√©ctor for a second‚Äù camp. Keep doing what you do. The rest will catch up later.,1548497899230601219,skennedy88,49753397,45752511
@dcsportsking @hgomez27 All credit to Hector. All I did was check with our sources to confirm his news and stand with someone I respect. I knew Hector would be proven right. They called it inaccurate but yet they could never say what was inaccurate about it.,1548496481740435457,TalkNats,3433301056,45752511
@TalkNats @hgomez27 When do the writers who called you inaccurate and tried to ruin your reputation put in a retraction with an apology?,1548489464816680962,NatsHR2Win,360240931,45752511
I guess @TalkNats and I were inaccurate. The offer wasn't $425 million. It was $440 million to Juan Soto! https://t.co/PCON9u94If,1548483530765651969,hgomez27,255772191,45752511
"@dcsportsking @dougherty_jesse Good point. Why sign if you don‚Äôt know what owner you are signing with?  
A deal now would just enhance the value for current ownership.",1548396790969380864,tedreednc,349110724,45752511
