"@imryh Was asked to join a student run/class communications agency to make videos for our football team as a new client. 

Liked it so much I switched from being a film major to Tv/Video Production. Found the right opportunities and a lot of late nights to get to where I am now.",1551372382878720002,hidef3987,3302640422,19610980
"@imryh Thought I wanted to be in front of the camera and become the next Bob Costas. Thru internships I discovered I was more suited for behind the scenes/production work. First job was a part-time weekend editor at a CBS affiliate, now in a Senior level video position at a university.",1551371601848983560,Tony_Fuller,42081388,19610980
"@imryh Got obsessed with YouTuber creators (@Casey @MaxxChewning @Alphalete) and then started doing live video production for Fordham Athletics as a student. 

I was hooked on how videos/live videos made me feel and wanted to make people feel that way for a living.",1551368694000934912,DBSantana55,4865536918,19610980

"@imryh Did the school news in middle and high school. Discovered a job in athletics during freshman year of college. Worked an ESPNU broadcast this May, my 4th year in school.

Not what I’m studying, nor will I spend the majority of my career doing it, but I love it nonetheless.",1551353556128698370,gurleen_s_,1031340151874768898,19610980
"@imryh Started with video production in high school, then transitioned to photography. I’m not sure when the graphic design “bug” hit me but now I’m all in. LoL. Trying to break into this field hasn’t been easy.",1551352324873981954,NickRice_10,36210118,19610980
Really excited to have you starting full-time with us tomorrow Isaac. You also picked your most basic skill for this pic and should have went way bigger. #Humble https://t.co/6O3RFKKV0f,1551350392436494336,EFrey82,1543569728,19610980
"@imryh Started with taking photos of my kids. When they hit middle/high school, wanted better quality gear to get better shots

Figured since I had the gear might as well use it elsewhere

HS &amp; College Sports, weddings, portraits. Then I found video &amp; graphics...never looked back 😁😤",1551348097908973569,texassportshots,1037060924052578305,19610980
"Went to college to be a big shot CPA and work at PWC or Deloitte. 
Freshman year I signed up for @WZBCSports during my walk through the dust bowl at BC. @TShanny13 gave me a shot! The following year I changed my major and haven’t looked back since! I absolutely love what I do! https://t.co/JacZicFMIF",1551346353447604224,Luis_MyW,180819481,19610980
"@imryh Ocal cable access station when I was (gulp) 11 years old. Didn't really learn anything in school for it, had a couple great mentors that taught me a lot and gave me a few breaks. It's really a business that still has a lot of craft that can't be learned in a classroom.",1551345767834591234,snvboy,22216356,19610980
