@neyfidelrosario Losing weight does NEED to be mean lost of strength. You can still lose weight &amp; build weight. You don’t HAVE to be weak &amp; small. That’s what I was saying.,1467498499885477898,bethbork,66915263,3400199446
@neyfidelrosario This is what I meant. You need to use your legs are a base or foundation. Proper form can more the weight. https://t.co/UZ6RNiA1pS,1467497448956379136,bethbork,66915263,3400199446
