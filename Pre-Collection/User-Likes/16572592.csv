"I‚Äôm not going to get into targeting, or the interception process, but hopefully the ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just shoot the missile down‚Äù folks understand why that‚Äôs not quite as easy as it sounds.

"If we determine we *do* need to intercept the missile, we have about a 7 minute window in which that is a viable option.

"During that 28 minutes, several things will happen quickly: 

- We‚Äôll detect a launch almost immediately

"Preemption requires a good intelligence picture, assets in the region, and a (potentially illegal) order for a first strike.
