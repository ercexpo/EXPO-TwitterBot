"Ruzek’s undercover apartment was completely built on stage. It was important that the apartment looked rundown,but not abandoned. Our #ChicagoPD Art and Set Dec Depts had to be very specific with certain elements to ensure the intended tone of the scenes shot there were achieved! https://t.co/woli3GhwRA https://t.co/38prj2lVXC",1511890562994958336,WolfEnt,160708096,35105013
