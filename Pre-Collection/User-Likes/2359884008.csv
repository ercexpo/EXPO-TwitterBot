"@LazyLos_ It’s a different beast when you’re playing pass-happy QBs who can tear you apart in the air, to be fair. They’ll be playing some similarly principled front spacing this year hopefully.

"Too often we reward people who solve problems while ignoring those who prevent them in the first place.

Instead of glorifying those who run around putting out fires, we need to create an organizational culture that empowers everyone to act responsibly at the first sign of smoke.",1552625289410351106,farnamstreet,112290748,2359884008
