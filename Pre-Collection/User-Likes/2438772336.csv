He made a 6 footer on his last hole.. shot 69.. and survived a 7 for 5 playoff to earn his spot‼️‼️

Clutch stuff from the incoming freshman!

"Super pumped for Jackson on qualifying for the US Junior today at Owensboro Country Club. He was second qualifier behind another ULGC member, Brady Smith - both boys are long time students and both are going to Bandon Dunes to play for a USGA championship. https://t.co/eKq4LGWOb2",1541587011697614849,mfinneygolf,947896262,2438772336
