"Miguel Vargas coming up will be awesome. Strong bat, high potential and he’s MLB ready. He could be a great plug and play guy and make a impact on Day 1.

@reuben81691 Well said,1554594922329559040,Ethanshirazi24,3875665753,1393542794

By not making any moves I have to assume the Dodgers feel May is going to be able to jump into the starting rotation. I have to believe they know Buehler is coming back and that Treinen will be good to go. If those things are true we are in great shape #dodgers,1554593698419294208,dedicateddodge2,1514436269803294734,1393542794
