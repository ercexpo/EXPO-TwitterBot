"Located on the far south end of Maui, La Perouse Bay is the site of the last lava flow on Maui, dating back to 1790. As part of the 'Ahihi Kina'u Natural Area Reserve, the north area, Moanakala, remains an excellent choice for snorkeling when conditions are favorable. https://t.co/cidBdjOF8I",1547253776947478531,Maui,1395021,25963982

"You cant force someone to respect you,but you can refuse to be disrespected. Stay away from people who cant take responsibility for their actions and who make you feel bad for being angry at them when they do you wrong. 🔥👇🏻💚⭐️ https://t.co/IRvV2agZ0K",1546910107916804096,JdPowerzz,1482045046211977229,25963982
