"Today is our beloved #EmmettTill's 81st Birthday. He was a young man that shared his joy of life with everyone around him. Tragically, his life was cut short at age 14, but his legacy lives on. We will honor our promise to #MamieTillMobley, and keep his memory alive! 🕊🖤 https://t.co/ISz0YTxgMB",1551677564204339202,EmmettTill,124709648,159792940

"North Carolina's starting backcourt of RJ Davis (@ariidavis_) &amp; Caleb Love (@caleb2love) has been the model of durability in their first two years.

Neither has missed a single game.

They've both played in ALL 68 career @UNC_Basketball games.
