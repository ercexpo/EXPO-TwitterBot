I‚Äôm hoping the Knicks can sign Melo for his 20th season. He wanted the Knicks smoke when nobody had the guts. Heavy is the head that wears the crown as the king of NY. Hopefully he will come back and use what he has already learned to help his hometown team take the next step. #7 https://t.co/oVfIULKDlR,1553692014541152256,BigKnickEnergy_,760546003,114370133
