@damon_stewart @LikkitP The one roster gripe I really have this year is that they don’t have a 2nd natural right back. For whatever reason we can’t seem to develop them aside from Yedlin and Alex,1548478428969459712,3rdStringStar,196773474
@damon_stewart @LikkitP The last time he didn’t play was May 22nd and that was only because he got a dumb red card the game before. Look back at the game logs.
