"@JayHadHope @bozoid @NathieVR But yeah that massive stock drop was just them going back to where they were prior to covid. World shut down, more people used Facebook. People resumed life, they used Facebook less. https://t.co/hEpDtz3YH1",1550709543750991872,RuffTalkVR,1396798094818283520
"@JayHadHope @bozoid @NathieVR Its their stock returning to where it was prior to covid. So much of their stock is based on daily active users. Which, during lockdown, skyrocketed. When the world returned to normal, their daily active users dropped and they reported it during forecasted earning, stock dropped",1550708937514688515,RuffTalkVR,1396798094818283520

@Thrilluwu And I think we should embrace them as such instead of praying for big established studios to come in and get the buck after these teams paved the way while we kick them to the side. I‚Äôll be more excited for any Resolution Games new title than if I see EA coming to the Quest.,1550269478763745281,RuffTalkVR,1396798094818283520
"@Thrilluwu And these indie devs are carrying the torch strong. I don‚Äôt exactly know the obsession (not saying you do, just in general) with these big companies doing VR. Historically they aren‚Äôt the best product. The Resolution Games, Fast Travel, Vertigo. They are our EA, Activison, etc.",1550269163645685760,RuffTalkVR,1396798094818283520
