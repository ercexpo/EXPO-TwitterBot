#HSFBCoaches Friday thoughts- some of the best HS Coaches are the ones no one hears of. They are practicing their craft in distant small rural communities or in the inner cities of our country. We should all recognize that the quality of a coach is not just state titles &amp; wins!,1547998112001601536,Coach_Kovo,887986338590584832
"Huge shoutout to @HoustonTexans ‚≠êÔ∏è OT @KingTunsil78 for helping make this a reality for those students! They will now train on the same control system as the college and pro leader @Daktronics &amp; can start careers in event production!! Thanks Laremy!üôèüèº
