Least it's good that they killed the piped in crowd noise so you can tell and what they need to work on especially with manufactured crowd noise the last two years. They did very good without big names like Roman or Brock etc. It's going to take time in this process.,1554482288351760385,BDPhotography88,1367138704507232256
"About the crowd last night, yes it was not as energetic but it was definitely a more casual crowd. Especially when you're shifting more towards talent that are newer to a casual audience or wasn't booked well before it's gonna take time. Houston crowds don't suck!",1554479528059207680,BDPhotography88,1367138704507232256

"Now if Triple H can work his magic w/ Smackdown then it's definitely up. A more wrestle heavy, build making sense w/ less filler is way more welcomed. I've tried to watch SD but end up tuning out.
