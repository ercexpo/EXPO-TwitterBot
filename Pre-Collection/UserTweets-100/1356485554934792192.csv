A much needed win to keep our playoff hopes alive! A tough Falcons that is much better than 4-9 gave us a great game that came down to the end. ‚Å¶@XCFLNetwork‚Å© https://t.co/dXujIN2ak9,1481789521809264643,XCFL_Nyrie,1356485554934792192
Tough loss in a tight game with the Lions and we fall short. The inconsistency of our offensive line has become a huge problem. 7 sacks cannot be given up in any game period! On the bright side our Rookie CB| Justin Teal got a dropped the bronze and leveled up! @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/EwC3vjIKzr,1481370800997425159,XCFL_Nyrie,1356485554934792192

Another great performance from the team. Defense came to play forcing plenty of turnovers all game. While offense delivered nearly every drive. Almost a perfect game on to the next! @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/jSH3E7KCRN,1480756872902844416,XCFL_Nyrie,1356485554934792192
"We pull off a win and upset the Bengals with an explosive offensive game. Aaron Jones had 19 attempts for 133 yds sadly no TDs. Aaron Rodgers went 12/18 241yds and 3 TDs. 
A nasty run defense kept the Bengals offense under wraps as we hold them to 19 yards rushing @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/dNBetgucp7",1480385739657519104,XCFL_Nyrie,1356485554934792192

After a hard fought battle we lose to the Vikings. We won the turnover battle but our Oline is sadly allergic to protecting the QB. Next up is our Bye week time to rest! @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/cDiHsOpgcu,1479146024056803334,XCFL_Nyrie,1356485554934792192

Huge win and just what we needed to kickstart the second half of the season! We fire ok all cylinders scoring on the ground and in the air. Defense and special teams killed grabbing 3 ints 2 for tds and forcing 2 fumbles taking 1 for a touchdown. @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/3padKEkgbh,1478172575851294720,XCFL_Nyrie,1356485554934792192

A beautiful sight as the 4th round pick Sherwood makes strides towards a bright future. Starting as a 69 ovr Normal Dev only 3 weeks later he is a 74 ovr Star! @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/NcAKEUvVZu,1476320008225660931,XCFL_Nyrie,1356485554934792192
Another early loss in the season as we have a tough schedule playing some top dogs. We held our own against the Chiefs minus some early mistakes. On the bright side Rookie Rafael Black forced his first fumble and Johnny Sherwood is now a star! @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/6AXsLGSw8c,1475728761689628674,XCFL_Nyrie,1356485554934792192
