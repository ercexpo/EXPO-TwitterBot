If you went for infections to build your immunity, It will be easier for you to get infected, as you wished https://t.co/e65KWZ1m2T",1537053472964616192,jennbick1,42530840

@BippetyBoop @Dement_Al @teaze_r Research is being done to try to determine if it is autoimmune or auto-inflammatory. (Based off prior research findings). I think it is one of the above. That’s why so many triggers can “tip it over” and bring it out.,1537052803989913600,jennbick1,42530840
"@BippetyBoop @Dement_Al @teaze_r It’s actually been around a long time. About 50% get it post virus (prior to covid), 10% post concussion, some bc of other illnesses like Sjogrens. 1:100 teens are affected. Vaccines have been known to cause it in a very small # of ppl. It’s commonly found in teens &amp; young women",1537052377978740737,jennbick1,42530840
