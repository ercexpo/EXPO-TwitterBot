I'm  good with it even though I loved what those 2 brought to the team",1550838630993764353,FrankJForte,459489682

@JamesonCoop I second this.,1550837464822124547,FrankJForte,459489682
@LitterBoxCats I mean at this point you would much rather give term to Tkachuk than Huby who is 29..did great things here no doubt..but signing Huby and Weegs was going to be tough in the current cap situation. This was a hockey trade,1550837027150651392,FrankJForte,459489682
"Wishing Huby and Weegs the absolute best. It’s always hard to see good players move, and there’s a lot of sentimental calls there. But, I bet there will be a ton of Tkachuk jerseys in the stands by January. Guy is incredible, and has a rare skill set.",1550836492318265344,FrankJForte,459489682
