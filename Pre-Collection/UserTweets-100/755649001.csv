@reaver_troll @astaranx I personally don't like MOST of those GOTY games. Not my cup of tea.,1554607538993123329,ThunderWolfDrew,755649001
@BananaBoyardee @reaver_troll @astaranx Most of those games weren't MADE for a service though. The industry hasn't transitioned enough yet. They were made for regular release and then PUT ONTO GamePass. When we start getting games like Netflix Original Movies then we'll probably see a dip in quality.,1554607434223665152,ThunderWolfDrew,755649001
