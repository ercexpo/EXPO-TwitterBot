"Glory goes to God in every outcome. We are undeserving of the abilities, relationships, and passion He’s gifted to us. It’s humbling being able to wear your heart on your sleeve battling under His name. We are so unworthy of these things, but His love is so much greater. #butGod",1515491599786123267,Raven_Softball,912084050139074560
