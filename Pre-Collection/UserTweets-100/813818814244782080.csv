"@CoachWaggonerGT @themtnthicket @bulldog4gp @GPHSHighlanders Let me tell you, as a guy who played against GP in the 80s, there nothing better than lining up against the Highlanders. It was 3yds and a cloud of dust all night. Games were over quick because neither Gibbs or GP put the ball in the air more than 5 times a game! Great memories",1522835438062424065,Gibbs_Football,813818814244782080
