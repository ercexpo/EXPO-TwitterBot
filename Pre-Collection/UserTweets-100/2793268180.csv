@AnthonyLaragar1 Kim herself said she was over that feud. Kris is just a big meme on social media and it was funny. Literally only swifties are giving attention to a Khloe like😭,1554541907434512387,lovelybride89,2793268180
@historyitstime @wildestscreamz It’s true😭,1554541190304899077,lovelybride89,2793268180
"@ThisIsMeTanking @burgundygrande Also if she wanted to release a rerecorded track along with the announcement like she did with Love Story, it should be THE blank space and not bad blood😭 still she needs to stop releasing songs from that album. She saw the huge success of Red TV without any pre-release single",1554541016451014664,lovelybride89,2793268180
@ThisIsMeTanking The way that song is threatening us. Another film is using it😭,1554540752453107714,lovelybride89,2793268180

@wildestscreamz Her hair looks kinda meh considering she should be filming a mv,1554540120543567872,lovelybride89,2793268180
@ThisIsMeTanking 2017 was a mess for pop music. None of the BPVA nominees were nominated in AOTY. I still think rep is more cohesive than Lover but rep had 0 appeal to the Grammy voters,1554534882893758465,lovelybride89,2793268180
@ThisIsMeTanking After all these years i finally accepted it deserved it that BPVA more than rep,1554533165255036929,lovelybride89,2793268180

It’s different bc Taylor didn’t sample them to create the sonf. They got credited a few days before the release of LWYMMD bc her team told her it sounded similar to IMTS https://t.co/DgoeyWwhuy,1554504225278885889,lovelybride89,2793268180

I really can’t believe how ugly and cheap Gaga’s stage is. I live for big productions and this type of big artists are the ones who should be doing that. The stage design and technology for the Joanne Tour was insane so i had high expectations https://t.co/u5UQNfFiXK,1554365579406053376,lovelybride89,2793268180
@TheTitanBaddie I think the only big artist from our generation that had a popular cover was Adele with Make You Feel My Love and it wasn’t even that big.,1554360282650214401,lovelybride89,2793268180
"@TheTitanBaddie It was also weird how big artists got big hits with covers (i will always love you, a natural woman, without you). That doesn’t happen this century and it might bc of the huge impact that MJ and Madonna had in this century’s pop music and they never did that",1554360084381270016,lovelybride89,2793268180
I will cry so much when Taylor gets honored in the Kennedy Center in 2050😭😭😭,1554358191504367617,lovelybride89,2793268180

@Lights91_13 Mine también fue robada del #1 porque tuvo que ser lanzada en el medio de la semana por que se filtró. Si hubiese tenido una semana completa era un debut en el #1 asegurado. Rompió el record de mas ventas en una semana en iTunes  en ese momento,1554333967112933376,lovelybride89,2793268180
"@Lights91_13 Taylor tambien utlizo remixes para asegurarse sus últimos #1 asi que no se si lo llamaria trampa😭 OTR fue un hit enorme y justo cuando Taylor arrancó la era Lover, OTR estaba teniendo su pico en la radio. Taylor merecía más #1 por canciones como LS, YBWM o IKYWT",1554333574396010496,lovelybride89,2793268180

"@zoenchanted If it’s the best album of the year it deserves it but i think that looking at her career in the future and thinking abour how big self-titled and Lemonade were (mostly in terms of impact and not sales), it will be weird to see that the album that gave her AOTY is this one",1554313366092619778,lovelybride89,2793268180

None of this song were a big moment bc of its lyrics like ATW10MV except maybe Glimpse Of Us. But they still didn’t give it to Driver’s License last year when it had some of the most impactful lyrics of the century so I bet Harry or Adele are taking it https://t.co/98jIELzKww,1554309736480260097,lovelybride89,2793268180

@______nicki @fedeebongiorno Es admirable porque 4 fue considerado un “flop” y en lugar de frustarse dio vuelta a toda la industria con el lanzamiento de Beyoncé. Intentó tener varios hits con 4 y todos flopeaban y con Beyoncé ni siquiera lo intentó,1554245089404358657,lovelybride89,2793268180
@fedeebongiorno Ademas los rerecordings pueden ser demasiado predecibles y eso hace que haya menos hype con cada uno que saca. Sabe que tiene que hacer cosas impredecibles para tener exito y sacar un nuevo album para fin de año seria perfecto,1554244720569860096,lovelybride89,2793268180
@fedeebongiorno Creo que es obvio que con esta espera desde Red TV se viene nuevo album para poder hacer un tour el año que viene y sacar los rerecordings mientras esta de tour. Sabe que sacar 6 rerecordings seguidos es un autosabotaje especialmente con todo el hype que tiene ahora,1554244347251625984,lovelybride89,2793268180
@dingcalypse Your fave is the only one who has released only 4 albums in 14 years of career and she actually gets benefited by that. Taylor also has very few features compared to Rihanna,1554235422062133248,lovelybride89,2793268180
"@dingcalypse No one is saying Taylor is exactly like Madonna or Adele is exactly like Shania but the Shania example shows that 1 or 2 big projects doesn’t mean anything. Also the China thing is stupid. Taylor has similar amount of albums as Rihanna, Gaga or Beyonce",1554235129958211585,lovelybride89,2793268180

"@ortegaswift13 @historyitstime We’re just predicting and thinking about what could be the best thing.

@historyitstime @ortegaswift13 No one is shading rep😭 it was just bad promo choices. It could’ve been way bigger and get 3 #1’s,1554203914542624768,lovelybride89,2793268180
@ortegaswift13 @historyitstime She knows the game but her last big rollout got 2 #2’s😭,1554203736272257026,lovelybride89,2793268180
@ortegaswift13 @historyitstime RFI had a huge debut as a promo single and then they released as a single like a month later. It was a mess. Then the fandom thought Gorgeous was going to be a single too. Then the End Game mess. It was all a mess,1554203254615162886,lovelybride89,2793268180
@historyitstime @ortegaswift13 VMAs will be used for ATW promo😭 she’s going with Dylan and Sadie so she wouldn’t be performing a new lead there. She might just tease the aesthetic of the new era with her look like she did in the 2019 iHeart Radio Awards,1554202915019145218,lovelybride89,2793268180
"@ortegaswift13 @historyitstime Announcing a new album 5 months before would be a mess😭 a new album isn’t the same as a rerecording and if this album is more mainstream than folklore/evermore, she would want a single on the radio.",1554202283763802119,lovelybride89,2793268180
"@ortegaswift13 @historyitstime Red also had 5 pre-release songs in 2012 but that worked at that time. Taylor has seen how much hype surprise releases have so just 1 song before the album and leave all the other for the hype of the release. We all know 30
would’ve debuted with +100M streams if it was a surprise",1554201940795572229,lovelybride89,2793268180
@ortegaswift13 @historyitstime rep rollout was a mess. 2 unnecessary promo singles that nobody knew if they would eventually become official singles. A promo single turned into a radio single even when it didn’t have radio potential and we heard 5 out of 15 songs before the album bc she also performed NYD,1554201431879684097,lovelybride89,2793268180
@sacredoasis2 @historyitstime She has already done that twice and it’s getting tiring. We need a big lead and it’s also a big chance for her to get a big hit. I hope she isn’t releasing promo singles like she always did bc they’re unnecessary,1554200366891339778,lovelybride89,2793268180
@historyitstime Bc it was a horrible song and her hype collapsed.,1554200123537854466,lovelybride89,2793268180
@historyitstime Making people wait 3/4 months for the album or release 4/5 songs before it like she did with rep/Lover would be a big mistake in 2022. We need a big lead single a month before and nothing more. Then as 2nd single the song that people choose like Late Night Talking or Oh My God,1554199717428563971,lovelybride89,2793268180
@historyitstime It’s not 2014 anymore. We’ve seen how amazing surprise albums or albums with no pre-release singles like Red TV perform. People don’t want 5 songs before listening to the album like Billie did. The hype needs to stay until the album release as it was a surprise release,1554199394702004225,lovelybride89,2793268180
@historyitstime ATW might win VOTY at the VMAs and that gives it a big chance for Music Video at the Grammys. Also IBYTAM might get a nomination and there’s still hope for ROTY and SOTY for ATW.
