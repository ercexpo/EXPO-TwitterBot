"Learned skills that are simple!

not easy:

‚úî Sprinting the floor

‚úî Closing out with a high hand 

‚úîBeing active in off ball defense

Legit 6-6/6-7 wing moves well off the ball, quick release off the catch. Pure stroke and can get his shot off whenever he wants with his size. @PurePrepHoops",1525516618067066881,PurePrepHoops,2763252252
