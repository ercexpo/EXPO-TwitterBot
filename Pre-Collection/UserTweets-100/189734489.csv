As a #Cubs fan I empathize with #Nationals fan. The parallels are similar. Both win Championship only to see thier beloved core Baez/Bryant/Rizzo/Schwarber/ soon to be Contreras and Happ. Harper/Rendon/Turner/Scherzer/ now Soto all leave the club. Banners fly forever I guess.,1554501374632611840,RobbieRob23_,189734489
Losing a Top 5 player who is only 23 is tough but all things considering the return on Soto is quite a haul. https://t.co/TvDw2bxikq,1554496975285862401,RobbieRob23_,189734489
