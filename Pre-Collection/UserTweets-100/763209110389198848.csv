@Melinda72614 @kellyclarkson 100% plus we don't want her to have to talk about that stuff anyway we are here for her music and her talent not for her personal life. I think almost all of us stay off that topic on purpose out of respect for her and people close to her!,1552751816143691776,Khaleesi_ellieg,763209110389198848

Yaaas @kellyclarkson you wanna talk to them! I have all the faith that it would be your favorite interview you've ever done!

"@defonas420 @AXE @WylanTalksRap Bless your heart we can't all have good taste though! Cole will always win over Kayne not even close. Kanye thinks too highly of himself and it ruins him for me. I'm ok with confidence, but hes a cocky shit for no reason! He was good in the early 2000s that's it. https://t.co/3HAczevA3w",1552635099388280832,Khaleesi_ellieg,763209110389198848
