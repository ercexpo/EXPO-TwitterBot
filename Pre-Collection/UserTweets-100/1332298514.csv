ESPN is loving the ability to rag on the #RedSox  - Chaim has turned this team into a laughing stock,1554275568472190976,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514

@redsoxstats Chaim Bloom not even trying to get him last year still haunts me,1554247483722801154,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514

@BostonStrong_34 JD can’t wait to get out of town.. this year has been a dumpster fire.  Didn’t address any of the things we needed this off-season,1554243237514199040,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
@BostonStrong_34 Chaim Bloom is a big league cuck.,1554240496813342725,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
@BNightengale @JeffPassan .230 Average.. sounds like a Red Sox player if I’ve ever seen one.,1554240071917867008,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
@ColeyMick He’ll fit right in with his .230 average.  I hate it here.,1554239877344116744,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
@IanMBrowne Can we trade Chaim?,1554238861336875008,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
@RedSoxLA The Boston Red Sox pulling him away cameras because they are trying to save face -  they probably intended on saying he asked for the trade.  Joke organization.,1554238627420545024,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
"@Jared_Carrabis I don’t know that I’ve hated anyone as much as I hate Chaim Bloom, not for this trade, but for being an absolute joke as a GM for a big market team",1554237229303844864,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
Chaim Bloom is going to go down as the worst GM in #RedSox history.  2 of the worst off seasons I’ve ever seen and forced to have a fire sale at the deadline.  Get this Guy out of here,1554236992963153923,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514

What Chaim Bloom and Ownership group have done to #RedSox is flat out embarrassing.  Sam Kennedy on WEEI and Chaim talking to reporters just spewing the same save face garbage is a joke.,1552094993124311040,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
@Jared_Carrabis Renfroe has the same amount of HRs as JBJ/Verdugo/Refsnyder and Hernandez combined. Way to go Chaim,1552093929738276864,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514

@BostonStrong_34 Boo the absolute shit out of the owners and Chaim if they show their dumb faces.  Please.,1551260722151178241,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514

The #RedSox will most likely be sellers at the deadline and unload some of their biggest contracts.  The ownership group is doing exactly what they intended - they want a “competitive team” that will cost them next to nothing.  Bogey and Evoldi are probably gone in 2 weeks.,1550857662685855744,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514

Chaim Bloom is loving the Chris Sale injury - he has been rooting for this team to fail since he got here -  The #RedSox will be sellers at the deadline and wouldn’t be shocked if Xander is gone.  The Sox imploding the last 3 weeks justifies the sell off coming.,1548731803967569920,Angry_RedSoxFan,1332298514
