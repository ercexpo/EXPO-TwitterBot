Don’t get me wrong. Mo isn’t off the hook. But I do like Quintana and Montgomery.,1554594130218700803,hitman6498,28853819
@KnuppelRodney He’s really not. I looked up his stats,1554590534907355137,hitman6498,28853819
Guys Montgomery is a legit pitcher,1554590033784479746,hitman6498,28853819
I hate seeing @aybaybader leave I really do. But Cardinals needed a pitcher. And Montgomery is a good pitcher.,1554589818360848385,hitman6498,28853819
I actually like Montgomery. He’s a solid starter and he’s a lefty.,1554588039493599235,hitman6498,28853819
Holy hell Montgomery!!!,1554587024446865409,hitman6498,28853819
@jhadleyconrad Way beyond!,1554581558685736961,hitman6498,28853819
The sad thing. Cardinals could win this weak ass division and probably won’t. Have Goldy and Nado and won’t make the WC and our Front office is just fine with that!,1554579443439607808,hitman6498,28853819
@K1NGCART3R Mo don’t watch that stuff lol,1554578744299380738,hitman6498,28853819
@HighSock_Sunday @todmeisner He’ll spout the same shit he does every year.,1554577066347094019,hitman6498,28853819
"@cigarmike Exactly!!!! Fuck it. If you’re not willing to trade them. Okay fine, play them!!!!",1554575178067320838,hitman6498,28853819
@ukcats21 @stevedoyel Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1554574496794918919,hitman6498,28853819
@AJDett Exactly!!!,1554574261699973121,hitman6498,28853819
@Tyree901 Sad is I can actually hear him saying that.,1554573050921754626,hitman6498,28853819
@itsasodie @ThereGoesAlex_ @Jess_Letterman Dude I would take that!!!! And throw in Joc Pedersen. It’s just frustrating to do one move and then stop. Especially with this weak division.,1554572452113555456,hitman6498,28853819
@eric_champion Right!!!!!!!!,1554572167811137542,hitman6498,28853819
@eric_champion You know what I got blasted by some dude for daring to critique the great John Mozaliek!!!,1554571205230956544,hitman6498,28853819
@jhadleyconrad Totally disgusting!!!!,1554570094264651778,hitman6498,28853819
"Seeing all the rivals making moves and Cardinals stop at Quintana. That just burns, you know.",1554568858836533250,hitman6498,28853819
@Jess_Letterman Oh so you can slam Mo? But I can’t lol,1554568418317287429,hitman6498,28853819
Will the Cardinals seriously not make another move????,1554567341610082304,hitman6498,28853819
@itsasodie @ThereGoesAlex_ @Jess_Letterman And I loved those moves.,1554566377633157121,hitman6498,28853819
@itsasodie @ThereGoesAlex_ @Jess_Letterman I respect your opinion. But I have to disagree. For one this division has declined. When did Mo take over for Jocketty. I believe the 2011 WS team was Jocketty. What has Mo done since? Not getting Scherzer is still unacceptable to me. And it appears their goal is to just get in.,1554564889473081345,hitman6498,28853819
@itsasodie @ThereGoesAlex_ @Jess_Letterman Are you seriously defending this front office?,1554563324083322880,hitman6498,28853819
@itsasodie @ThereGoesAlex_ @Jess_Letterman But do they? Do they really?,1554563102766686213,hitman6498,28853819
@jonmorosi @MLB @MLBNetwork This boggles my mind that Mozaliek sat on his hands after the Quintana move.,1554562908448866306,hitman6498,28853819
@ThereGoesAlex_ @Jess_Letterman We love our team. But we question our FO.,1554560969195544578,hitman6498,28853819
I will root for any player that wears the Birds On The Bat. Having said that the front office has let the team and skipper and fans down. And the worse part. They don’t care. As long as Busch Stadium is packed,1554559827506089985,hitman6498,28853819
What’s mind boggling. The Brewers are saying hey Cardinals here you go. Mo “no we’re good “,1554557079024697346,hitman6498,28853819
Look Mo!!!! https://t.co/4AckwZY1A0,1554556755031515137,hitman6498,28853819
Anyone defending Mo and this Front office. How many times do they gotta do this to the fans,1554555533121708033,hitman6498,28853819
@STLfan006457 @zSTLBluesGuy Well said,1554555231278710784,hitman6498,28853819
All the Wild Contenders making moves. Meanwhile the Cardinals “crickets “,1554555160172662786,hitman6498,28853819
Phillies working. Mo “ I’ll have that box of pretty bow ties@,1554554635389640704,hitman6498,28853819
It’ll never happen. But if the Cardinals don’t make another move and miss the playoffs. Does Mo finally get fired? Or will Girsch be the fall guy?,1554553011736813568,hitman6498,28853819
@TommyB_641 @Niko21536776 Oh good. Thanks for pointing that out lol,1554547152206151684,hitman6498,28853819
@RealChrisTweek Yeah which is why it won’t happen.,1554546040862294020,hitman6498,28853819
Of course #STLCards https://t.co/aXq4jk0NGa,1554545871005667328,hitman6498,28853819
Carlos Rodon. Joc Petersen. Make it happen Mo. #STLCards #MLBTradeDeadline,1554544690602680320,hitman6498,28853819
@18neverforget @Cardinals It’ll never happen man,1554534483881299972,hitman6498,28853819
@DJstada18 Nahhh he’s probably got the safest job in all of baseball. No way DeWitt will ever fire him.,1554534345242714113,hitman6498,28853819
@BaldesGarrett Oh I’m not. I just know how the Cardinals front office works. They literally don’t know you can make more than one move,1554534200589557760,hitman6498,28853819
Can tell you one team they’re probably not talking to. #STLCards because Mo has done his one trade and is now rewarding himself by shopping for more now ties. https://t.co/0RYNhgt8aR,1554533874188910605,hitman6498,28853819
Of course the #STLCards aren’t in on Rodon. Mo has done his one trade a year thing. What a joke of a front office #MLBTradeDeadline,1554532894764421120,hitman6498,28853819
@rachxboyd I’ll never turn on DC,1554531853322928130,hitman6498,28853819
@JohnDenton555 I’ll believe it when I see it.,1554521755238256640,hitman6498,28853819
Rodon Joc. Do it Mo!,1554518919490174976,hitman6498,28853819
@kchilders Yup,1554518595413106689,hitman6498,28853819
"I am gonna be rooting so hard for Dylan. Now Mo, go get Rodon. Cardinals are still in need of pitching",1554505015552770048,hitman6498,28853819
@JonahDurbin I will support Carlson!,1554502768844472323,hitman6498,28853819
I’m so rooting hard for Dylan because it’s not his fault.,1554498183245479936,hitman6498,28853819
Until Mo is fired this organization will always settle for just getting in the playoffs. Screw the division and a World Series. And wasting Goldy and Nado best years. Hey Mo 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕,1554497950516142081,hitman6498,28853819
@cigarmike @BluesPackCards There’s no defending if what SD gave up is true!,1554496765285568513,hitman6498,28853819

@JonahDurbin We have the stupidest FO in baseball!!!,1554495252563730432,hitman6498,28853819
If Mo does not go after Rodon and Joc now he can just jump off the Arch,1554495109940609028,hitman6498,28853819
I fucking hate Mo,1554494572406906880,hitman6498,28853819

@ThaGreatOne99 Won’t be the White Sox. Pham hates LaRussa,1554234833949302787,hitman6498,28853819
Guys let’s face it. The Cardinals will sit pat. Mo’s reasoning. Brewers trading Hader was as good as a trade. I can absolutely hear his whiny voice saying that,1554228847637397505,hitman6498,28853819
@gemmamarierose @Faithdreams11 Done,1554161379690545153,hitman6498,28853819
