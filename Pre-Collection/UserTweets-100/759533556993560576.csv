This dude is a ground ball machine. Throwing frisbees up there and FB has a lot of sink to it. https://t.co/Y3v9uM9hXW,1542891640288845824,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
A lot to like about George Gilson (2024 uncommitted @SJCDbaseball ) at catcher. Large athletic frame behind dish with advanced glove work. Arm really plays at next level. https://t.co/EQ6fPGNets,1542891191989141504,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
Kolt Myers (2024 @USFBaseball ) is absolute stud. High upside on mound and the dude can swing it. https://t.co/rP7SZBuHbT,1542890676999839744,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
@DodgersScoutTm 2023 INF Kellen Brown with a bullet up the middle in West Palm today!! Kid can really swing it. #uncommitted https://t.co/TF5y9neyYo,1542272844112994306,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
Will Studebaker (2023 uncommitted @Bolles_Baseball ) with great outing today down in West Palm. Tall athletic frame kid with lots of room for more velo. Slider is plus pitch now. https://t.co/TbMS37lXN7,1542272768921698305,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576

There is nothing not to like about Jack Newman (2023 uncommitted) has limited swing and misses and power to all parts of the field. About to make someone very happy at next level. https://t.co/1aBNd0WsGr,1542220891576324098,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
#Uncommitted 2023 OF @VicPatel17 of @DodgersScoutTm shows off his gap-to-gap power here as he crushes a ball to deep LC for an RBI double. Present feel for the barrel with fast hands from the LH side. Strong follow. @SJCDbaseball @DiamondProMedia #PSWS https://t.co/VMR1kXokfs,1542215436879728640,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
This kid works at his craft cerebrally. I‚Äôve had the privilege to be part of his development from a data tracking side via @Blast_Bsbl and @rapsodo for over a year. He‚Äôs a sponge and is able to adjust. A target if you are looking for a LH bat! https://t.co/t6fB691j4R,1542183794014298117,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
This dude can swing it. Kody Daneault (2024 uncommitted @SJCDbaseball) batted over .400 this spring and continuing to find barrels this summer. Lefty bat that runs it up to 85 on mound as well. https://t.co/JujaBMcWoZ,1542181286948782082,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
Camdon Frier (@FSUBaseball ) is as good an athlete in 2024 class as there is. Blazing speed on bases makes every hit/BB a double. https://t.co/Bg8zOFQ7iu,1542145588766167049,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
"‚Äò23 RF/1B Vic Patel (@DodgersScoutTm) crushes a ball  deep to the left center gap for a 2 RBI double.  Quick, compact swing, quick hands, and stays through the ball. Has some juice behind his swing, and can spray it to all sides of the field. #uncommitted  #PSWS https://t.co/HlkDNwETlN",1542136449595760641,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
Quite an offensive start to the day for #Uncommitted 2023 1B/LHP @jacknewman34 of @DodgersScoutTm as he goes yard for the second time. Big offensive follow. @DPMUncommitted #PSWS https://t.co/qr4xjRVFQt,1541954155937501184,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
"2023 Vic Patel @DodgersScoutTm 

Lean, Athletic frame. Short to the ball with an uphill path. Works the pull side.

Another lefty bat on 2023 team with a lot of pop to all fields. Vic Patel takes this one to RCF and short hops fence. https://t.co/lRElZPM5ZI,1541922826856300544,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
Levi Pietschker (2025 uncommitted @Bolles_Baseball ) is toolsy OF with a sweet lefty swing. Big things ahead for this guy! https://t.co/fNDi1oYyeQ,1541914156747706369,DodgersScoutTm,759533556993560576
