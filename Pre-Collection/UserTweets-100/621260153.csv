"EVERYTHING starts with awareness.

Want to get better at something?

Start by becoming aware of what you‚Äôre bringing to the table AND what you‚Äôre not.",1541882354909814786,SwimSSCRoyals,621260153
"I think there‚Äôs a message here for all of us.  What would happen if we just focused on being better than our previous best?  The more you progress in the sport, the harder it will be to go best times, and the more work and time it will require to achieve those times!
