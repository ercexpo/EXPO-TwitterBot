@smb_ryan I'm with you dude.  How many times are they gonna do this?  It's hard to get excited about any non-Batman project because they might pull the plug even if the movie is done lol,1554592005493325826,FinalE33,27736412
@shewrick @JustinMKowalski Nothing ever is with WB,1554590496886067200,FinalE33,27736412
@asarathy Well my initial tweet here the Variety article says it doesn't have to do with the film quality and the NY Post initial report says it's irredeemable.  It sounds to me the it's terrible news is PR for the studio to justify canceling it.,1554590411854864388,FinalE33,27736412
@asarathy There's a huge difference canceling an entire streaming service that is just starting and movie that is already finished and paid for.,1554589664400625665,FinalE33,27736412
"@shewrick @JustinMKowalski There's mixed reports on how good the film is, and saying it's bad helps the studio save face by shelving it.",1554589480027394049,FinalE33,27736412
"@asarathy So?  There is literally zero risk with releasing the movie.  In fact, it might even bring in subscribers to HBO Max.",1554589226636918785,FinalE33,27736412
@asarathy Dude the film is completed.  It's done.  Had he made this decision before it shot I would understand but he didn't.  How does not releasing it on HBO Max benefit anyone?  This wasn't a theatrical release anyway and according to reports the actors got paid up front.,1554588556592562181,FinalE33,27736412

"It's kind of crazy that a movie with Michael Keaton and J.K. Simmons in it won't even get released after $90 million was spent on it.
