It sure sounds like the Flyers are a team to watch today... seems like alot of cap space is being cleared for a certain someone. Stay tuned. #BringItToBroad,1547065121297629184,B_Sommermann,389500642
"It happened with JVR, now it seems it will happen with Johnny Gaudreau. If a player wants to play in a certain city, you cant fault that player for doing that. Gaudreau waited, allowed the Flyers to open cap space, now at 12:01pm tomorrow, can discuss a contract. #BringItToBroad https://t.co/2a9flxJmmQ",1547065032474779648,B_Sommermann,389500642
"As Ive been saying‚Ä¶ there is a census around the league that Gaudreau wants to go to Philadelphia. But, money does talk &amp; if its north of $10M for Gaudreau, PHI is gonna have to offer up a pretty penny for him. Which, PHI seems to be doing with opening cap space. #BringItToBroad https://t.co/wx2cQbTNSO",1547064873007415296,B_Sommermann,389500642
"As I said when Fiala signed.. Forsberg gets close to $9M, sounds like $8.5M on new deal. If Flyers can make enough cap space and enter Gaudreau sweepstakes with an offer in $9-9.5M range, they will definitely have a great shot at him. #BringItToBroad https://t.co/gf9g6I1BU5",1547063167569854464,B_Sommermann,389500642

"As Anthony says, things could change &amp; if Gaudreau tells his agent to call the Flyers at 12:01pm tomorrow to tell them he wants to sign with them, boy oh boy does Chuck Fletcher have his work cut out for him. Gonna cost a kings ransom to make it work. #BringItToBroad https://t.co/0qoVzj6tMu",1547019027360452612,B_Sommermann,389500642
"Johnny Gaudreau informed the #Flames he will not be returning to Calgary. Emotional conversation for both sides, as the Flames rolled out the red carpet to keep him.

A massive offer was presented, as we reported, but this wasn't about money.",1547014585567395844,B_Sommermann,389500642
