Man you know what was a good ass band? Bomb the Music Industry. Listening to 'Scrambles' and it's straight through bangers. Better than Jeff's solo stuff if we're being honest.,1554392985567207424,theblanketparty,499915431
@naturalbornskil @tapemachines A dude I was in an e-fed with back in high school sent me a copy of The Origin of Symmetry and I couldn't really get into it so I never gave MUSE the time of day. Then they did that space knight song that they play at hockey games.,1554383420482097153,theblanketparty,499915431

Oh my god remember like a year ago when Gerard Way was trying to claim that MCR was a 2nd wave band? And like I get it. But the hot topic tweens made you the face of their whole thing and you got real rich off it so don't like you're better than the rest of the 3rd wave crap.,1554379568529678337,theblanketparty,499915431

@naturalbornskil Way back in the late 90s/early 00s I played in a bunch of shitty emo bands and it was a trip to see crowds change from bearded guys in corduroy pants and Indian Summer shirts to 16 year old girls with weird hair and Hawthorne Heights shirts.

My reread of all the major Marvel runs post Heroes Reborn has finally come to Whedon's Astonishing X-Men.
