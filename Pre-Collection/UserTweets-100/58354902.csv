The Raiders play Thursday,1554095368715096067,KevCarde,58354902
Wish this man could have been a Raider forever https://t.co/m7WcLsZWcR,1553814665867759617,KevCarde,58354902
@dezlax1 Yeah. He‚Äôs not in the same conversation as Adams.,1551377231406145536,KevCarde,58354902
It‚Äôs okay he did steroids because he had a good smile. What an embarrassment the baseball hall of fame is. https://t.co/uRgN9PxP8q,1551304861915963392,KevCarde,58354902
@dezlax1 I see no reason the receptions and yardage aren‚Äôt there. The TD‚Äôs is what I‚Äôm slightly nervous about and what Carr has constantly struggled with but he‚Äôs also never had an option close to Adams down there so that‚Äôs gotta help.,1551283175518789634,KevCarde,58354902
@damnJAYfly12 That‚Äôs his boy. He‚Äôs just being a friend with that talk.,1551222408517926912,KevCarde,58354902
"Is Derek Carr as good as Aaron Rodgers? Obviously not.

Is Carr very good and will Adams be just fine with him? Absolutely. https://t.co/N9Su9jfq2b",1551215965869748227,KevCarde,58354902
Still crazy this is real https://t.co/ex8kRSYkuQ,1550631830138900483,KevCarde,58354902
@brettaverse Lamar deserves more than Murray. No disagreement right?,1550621169715388421,KevCarde,58354902
Once you see no @CrosbyMaxx you know it‚Äôs shit https://t.co/sIIjUbkZhd,1549479252420173826,KevCarde,58354902
@brettaverse I enjoy when people go nuts over guys going crazy not realizing it means he‚Äôs destroying other players on the team. Wide receiver being unstoppable also means your corners are getting cooked.,1549035584710053889,KevCarde,58354902
If anyone wants to see Justin Herbert beg for a tie turn on nfl network around 8:50.,1548791408806486016,KevCarde,58354902

@Bobstar30 https://t.co/CFoCCueS04,1547377014365208576,KevCarde,58354902
Remove RJ Barrett from this list and then ask yourself would you trade all of these players packaged together for Donovan Mitchell? https://t.co/iGtnkysgp4,1547319823818006531,KevCarde,58354902
@dezlax1 Yeah there‚Äôs some other things. I like this one though.,1546165287027965953,KevCarde,58354902
I respect this move https://t.co/8LknqRUMUC,1546096044202754048,KevCarde,58354902
@dezlax1 @EDnSantaPaula Does Cooper Kupp ask the hard hitting questions like this? I don‚Äôt think so. Case closed. https://t.co/hHDLQDG6F8,1543424074319290368,KevCarde,58354902
"I would love if somehow the Knicks could move Randle and add Donovan Mitchell. Brunson, Mitchell, Barrett, Toppin, Robinson is a good young starting 5.",1542886017488883718,KevCarde,58354902
"KD, Kyrie, Harden, Simmons, 3 years and 1 playoff series win. This isn‚Äôt just a biggest failure in NBA history, this is the biggest failure in SPORTS HISTORY.",1542587406964166656,KevCarde,58354902
It‚Äôs amazing the Raiders had the top WR and one of the top tight ends in football and then added Davante Adams. Offense better put up 30 per game this season.,1541952254869180418,KevCarde,58354902

@dezlax1 Rodgers is definitely better than Carr but Adams chose Carr and has played with him so that‚Äôs gotta mean something,1533963559046205440,KevCarde,58354902
Almost made a thug shed a tear https://t.co/th0qebJ1gR,1533961680564133889,KevCarde,58354902

@dezlax1 Says A LOT about Jason Whitlock that the other guy felt comfortable saying that in front of him and he smirked. That‚Äôs what Whitlock is though so no surprise really.,1530569347814547458,KevCarde,58354902

@brettaverse I think most reasonable people would. I don‚Äôt see it ever happening though.,1530148167144067072,KevCarde,58354902
Would like to see results if the whole country voted on if ‚ÄúAR-15 class and capable guns‚Äù should be banned? Could still own handguns and rifles for hunting. I think banning them would win pretty convincingly.,1529936357405212684,KevCarde,58354902
