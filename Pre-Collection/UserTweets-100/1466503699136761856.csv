@JustCalebBrown Which means if he wins the position or started for us before we should prollly trust the coaching staff over our fan opinions...I will support whoever Tomlin chooses,1553175001850957824,shittycatDFS,1466503699136761856
@shittycatDFS The Sermon thing was weird tho. Guy had 2 1/2 good games with a great line playing mediocre defenses and Oklahoma &amp; OSU fans went nuts.,1553174779087175680,shittycatDFS,1466503699136761856
