- topper was late w the probables for the series so i did all 3 games before finding out about starters
- randy, choi, and b lowe love KC
- jason adam was a massive snub and mlb as a business is a joke

"Interesting move for all parties, and I’m not entirely sold on either player as a huge difference-maker. Still, both project as key rotation pieces by my reckoning.

Data-wise, Tampa Bay is the solid winner of the trade, but the ramifications aren’t massive for the table. https://t.co/0JJmtqvwNQ https://t.co/BrCYhMjK9d",1550265068834766848,RBLRSports,1191484724654428160

"Roman Quinn:

- good defender (71st percentile success rate among OF since 2016)

- fast AND good base runner (97th percentile sprint speed this season and 86th percentile base runner (BsR) since 2016

- below avg switch hitter (career 74 wRC+)

likely just a 4th OF/PR
