"The Republicans on the Supreme Court do not care about our rights, our democracy, or the rule of law. They care about the Republican Party agenda and will do whatever they can to advance it. This is not how country is supposed to function. #ExpandTheCourt.",1553900227475546112,ClaudineR66,128713577

"The Supreme Court is acting as the spearhead of a reactionary counter-mobilization against egalitarian, multiracial, pluralistic democracy. That‚Äôs exactly what Alito sees as his mission. America can accept this Court as legitimate - or it can have true democracy. But not both.",1553892178727907330,ClaudineR66,128713577
The idea that secularism is a threat that must not be tolerated is widely shared among religious reactionaries on the anti-liberal Right. Just read Bill Barr‚Äôs infamous 2019 Notre Dame speech. These people pursue a project that is deeply incompatible with pluralistic democracy. https://t.co/8ACpNMkw04,1553892027107909633,ClaudineR66,128713577
