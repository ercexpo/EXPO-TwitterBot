@Tipsy_Dixit True the Rockets have to implement more movement but the issue is the opposing big isn‚Äôt following Sengun/Garuba out of the paint,1554544019673419780,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584

@BiasedHouston From March 1st to the end of the year Tate shot 36.7 percent from 3 and Mathews shot 32.4. That's over a 20-game span. Mathews shooting dropped off a cliff second half of the year. He just not consistent enough and doesn't bring enough on defense to make up for it,1554498098340286466,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
@ChilcuttsDeep The problem was Wood wasn‚Äôt taking a lot of his shots in the flow of the offense. It was one on one plays and bringing the ball up off a rebound. Too many times the offense was stagnant because Wood would go one on one,1554493210126319616,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584

@BiasedHouston My issue with Mathews is he has zero court awareness on some of those shots. I can see it now Green 8-9 from 3 on fire and wide open but Mathews comes down  takes a 30 ft fadeaway 3 for a brick lol,1554480506015813633,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
"I could probably tweet the rest of the day with the number of times Green had zero space to operate in the paint, but here are a few more.

@KeldenRobertso1 A 15 million dollar contract for a 22 year old who shoots over 40 percent on catch and shoot 3s would not be hard to move. The Rockets were able to move C Wood who is in the last year of his deal and honestly has had more issues on the Rockets than KPJ has since coming to Houston,1551652766166224907,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
"Dallas probably felt they had all the leverage regarding an extension with Brunson. Up until last year, the most he had averaged was 12.6 points and 3.5 assists. Brunson wanted to sign an extension before last season at 4 yr 56 mil, but the Mavs said no.

"The Houston Rockets and Kevin Porter Jr. making a deal now is beneficial for both parties. For the Rockets, they can avoid a Jalen Brunson situation, and for Porter Jr., he can not end up in a situation like Dennis Schroder. https://t.co/rBM93qGKWH",1551613578817454084,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
Some good information from Bruce Pearl in this interview https://t.co/3ccVw6NC3W,1551600771069779974,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
I will continue to say it. Free agency and the draft aren‚Äôt the only ways to bring in talent these days. Disgruntled stars is the new way to bring in a star https://t.co/FWZMtxqKcv,1551588851730116608,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584

@Dr3wLeague If they go out next year and lose in the first round or even worse they may decide to blow up the team and try to get other pieces around Tatum. Remember Boston was struggling for a while last year almost to the point people were saying Udoka wasn't even a good coach,1551573751497740289,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
"@Dr3wLeague Right now, it is hard to say because it depends on what the Celtics may value at that point. Let's say Durant goes to Phoenix and those Brooklyn picks are now potential top 5 picks every year they may see that as a better asset than a borderline all star player from another team.",1551572125626126338,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
@tmimsdatwin 3 years is fair for both sides,1551568494659047425,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
Remember this day because if a deal doesn't happen and the Celtics flame out early in the playoffs Brown could be looking to move on. He is the type of star I would use cap space and draft capital on in a trade. Just something to keep in mind https://t.co/qIOnZZzV9r,1551568365671571456,BinkleyHoops,964288810820419584
