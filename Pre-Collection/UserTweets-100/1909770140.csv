"We all knew the #Preds couldn't possibly be done yet with their offseason moves. 

Add Nino Niederreiter to the mix! Great addition, short term at 2 years and $4M AAV.

"If Matthew Tkachuk was a grand slam, then Nino Niederreiter is at least a triple and driving in a couple runs.

#Preds have a solid looking lineup going into 2022-23. Without a doubt they have improved this offseason.",1550139666623447040,chad_minton,1909770140
Anyway Nino is one of the best guys you'll meet in the league and I wish him the best in Nashville!,1550139572239081477,chad_minton,1909770140
The Nino Niederreiter signing is a really good deal for Nashville. The Predators need offense and they bring in a forward below his market value without investing in term. https://t.co/mLI98ds6Ka,1550139516077449219,chad_minton,1909770140
