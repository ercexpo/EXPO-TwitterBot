@sondraa also i didn‚Äôt delete the tweet because i was being attacked or ratio‚Äôd. i never do. i hold my opinions and if they change i communicate that too without deleting anything prior to that. but it was clear people were using this as a platform to make themselves feel better.,1554472354687946753,AaronCornielle,118838668

@MikeDro_ no. the fact that these two things are not remotely related in the slightest. why does me complaining about joey gallo equate to me approving of domestic violence? you can‚Äôt possibly be this dense. you really think you did something.,1554468079660318720,AaronCornielle,118838668
