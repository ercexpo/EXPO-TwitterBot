@Real_Deal_RayJ I guess bron was suppose to lose before he reach finals so his finals record could look better,1548702037788999684,Real_Deal_RayJ,2764439024
Do you actually think Lebron wanted to leave Cleveland his hometown? Best players they gave him in 7 years was Mo Williams Big Z. If he had a team around him like Jordan did I guaranteed you he would have loved to make The Cavs dynasty for 2 decades bringing them home mult ships. https://t.co/myMGxueoGB,1548701933992640512,Real_Deal_RayJ,2764439024
They discredit Lebron losing in the finals like it would have been better for him to tank and not will/drag some of his teams there to be 4/4. Not to mention minus Mavs finals Lebron teams were never favorites to win as the Finals started.

You do realize how good Jordan‚Äôs team was around him? When he left his team still making playoffs. When LeBron leaves they lottery teams. His Cavs &amp; Heat teams.

Recap of NHL Season. Another great one same w NBA &amp; NFL. MLB has been a different story though.Time to strictly zone in on MLB and start profiting in that as well. Has been money in past. Not at all this season. Lot season left though. Those who know me know I am always grinding. https://t.co/ZfiC52fTXH,1541456673386205186,Real_Deal_RayJ,2764439024
This makes ZERO sense? NO one had Celtics winning it all before series started. Why they trying to make this championship look like some true under dog story? They were vegas favorites at every sports book and this NO WHERE close to Cavs 3-1 comeback 2 on road against 73 win GS. https://t.co/dOPJiUY7SR,1541378099786711040,Real_Deal_RayJ,2764439024

Fact they keep trying to point this out like the economy and businesses are thriving is sickening another fake narrative. Under Trump 7 million more people had jobs. Getting jobs back after the world was shut down is not creating jobs. I never seen so many help/hiring signs. üò°ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://t.co/VjqcGZHPbd,1537165474424832006,Real_Deal_RayJ,2764439024
