@Dehreeus How is this humbling her? Am I reading the same tweet I’m a Beyoncé fan as well. If you read the interview that I responded to and retweeted maybe it’ll make sense. Her lyrics themselves say they’re too hard on me. She wants the public to realize she’s human too tf,1554091079561105410,DeJa_Clift,98542449

@Niell_Standard Lmao I’m a Beyoncé fan so next it’s clear from her lyrics on this album and even in this interview that people don’t recognize she’s human and put unrealistic expectations on her,1554085815260790785,DeJa_Clift,98542449
