@SubwayToShea the starting pitching has been around the best in baseball since scherzer's been back but every game we all freak out around the 7th because who is the bridge to diaz. the pen arms are the most important thing.,1554315054975164427,K0jiii,474435885
@Mikelife213 @JackVincenzoNY @sam_skinner6 @NastyCanasta06 @martinonyc they would at the very least ask for baty to be a replacement at 3rd. which is why the mets aren't trading for devers. because they have a lot of faith in a guy they won't trade for anyone but soto or ohtani. why do you think escobar is on a two year deal.,1554313781047599108,K0jiii,474435885
@Mikelife213 @sam_skinner6 @NastyCanasta06 @JackVincenzoNY @martinonyc and the price to get someone who the red sox do not want to trade is blowing up your farm system and giving up someone like jeff mcneil and probably add peterson to that too. seems like a smart plan.,1554312013844811780,K0jiii,474435885

@Julio_DA they should have called vientos up already that's the biggest problem lol. give me some relievers and let's fucking ride. we aren't doing anything if our starting pitching can't stay healthy anyway.,1554180488411103232,K0jiii,474435885
@Julio_DA there are no massive difference maker dh bats in the market and what we have in vientos might be that so of course they're hesitant to trade him. and ramriez is a stud he's way more in the baty/alvarez part than the other two.,1554179701744214017,K0jiii,474435885
