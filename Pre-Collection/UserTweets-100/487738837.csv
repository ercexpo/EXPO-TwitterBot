@CoachAntBrown2 @mar5hallhoops @InsiderExposure Facts on that!!,1554246313281216514,ETAThunder,487738837
@CoachAntBrown2 No but the select 40 and then some big tourneys with independents could be established.   I get what your saying but it could be done.  That is why I think the shoe circuits watered down the competition. No one plays each other anymore like they did years ago.,1554245895532826626,ETAThunder,487738837
And we had 2!! 2023 teams!!,1554244838048014338,ETAThunder,487738837
@CoachAntBrown2 And top independents.   Don’t just take the shoe teams.   There is tons of talent not on a shoe circuit.   That would even make it more interesting!  And take the top 8 in each have a 32 team tourney,1554244544526434304,ETAThunder,487738837
Every one of our 23s have offers except one &amp; most of them multiple ones. And we are working hard to help the 1 reach her dream.  We go above and beyond to help our girls.
