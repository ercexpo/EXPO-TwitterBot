The difference is ciara is preaching be yourself and beyonce isnt being herself.I cant tell u anything about that woman she’s void of emotion. And i bet she likes it like that she doesn’t want us to know the real her lol. But u can not be on my favorites list if you’re being fake,1553935194998149121,SikiraT,84202669
