@ExtendJudgeHal @YankeesNerds I agree. He wasn‚Äôt going to see the postseason roster and we have lots of pitching depth to eat innings. Now we don‚Äôt have to rely on Hicks in the postseason.,1554608020600115208,NYCommonSense1,1436496657437372416
@JackCurryYES He is a top flight player and we traded our 5th starter for him. Schmidt has way more upside than Monty. Even Deivi Garcia does.,1554605774395039746,NYCommonSense1,1436496657437372416
