@Rmusacch @FutureSox You’re right — he’s 28 &amp; in his prime years. But some guys pop a little later. I also think he may be a free agent after this season so lots of factors at play. But Sox desperate for offense.,1546916767733358597,TripleAJeff,23798982
"This week gets more interesting by the minute!

(thanks to @camfreeman25 for spotting this first!)

@Tyler_Neslony7 &amp; Grandal should be a big offensive boost. If the pitching can continue recent improvements…

"Lots of player movement…

—Yasmani Grandal to Charlotte to continue his rehab.

—Romy Gonzalez due back from IL this week.

—Davis Martin to Sox for twin bill today.

—With Colas news, does Neslony (.326/.404/.578) get bumped to CLT?

@Rmusacch Pretty sure they’re all on the same Tues-Sunday schedule but they all did play this past Monday because it was July 4 and then took Tuesday off.,1546671384163745792,TripleAJeff,23798982
"@Rmusacch Sure. During Covid, MILB changed schedules to reduce travel. Every series was 6 games, Tues-Sun, Mondays for travel, &amp; teams also  played nearby teams. They kept the 6-game format this year but expanded geography, thankfully.",1546630960485175305,TripleAJeff,23798982
"@Noahp245 It is so hard to know, isn’t it? Gavin certainly got turned around, &amp; guys like Adolfo, Remillard &amp; Rutherford are showing improvement as well, so certainly could be CJ.",1546608022956523520,TripleAJeff,23798982
"@Mark_Marco_C Well, they may have to lose one of them as soon as Grandal comes off the IL because neither Seby or McGuire have options left.",1546575985776201728,TripleAJeff,23798982
"Knights home this week vs IronPigs (Philly).

Assuming Yasmani Grandal joins Knights to continue rehabbing.

Acting manager Julio Mosquera expected to return after tending to family matter last 2 weeks.

Romy Gonzalez back from IL.

"@DylansFadden @SoxMach_pnoles @scottmerkin Agree! Gavin is still going to need to be able to prove he can hit breaking balls, but he continues to improve &amp; it was pretty cool to see him get squared away so quickly when he was sent down last month.",1546495739475509250,TripleAJeff,23798982
@scottmerkin I chatted with Gavin shortly after he returned to Charlotte. He struggled for 2 days &amp; then began pounding everything. https://t.co/sbt48VC5Iu,1546323415363207171,TripleAJeff,23798982
