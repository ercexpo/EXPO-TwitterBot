The replies to this are depressing. These people have obviously never interacted with hearing or visually handicapped people. And she is addressing disability advocates. Dole spearheaded and Bush 41 signed ADA. @GOPChairwoman GOP mocks the disabled. Quite a change. https://t.co/fRk3NMv2YU,1552325860992192512,UncleJneutron,1157141647672504320
@JuanJuandiaz87 @Thorne75658284 @RNCResearch It is really depressing to see Republicans decide that being a piece of shit is a political platform.,1552324609013342208,UncleJneutron,1157141647672504320

Hey @JasonKander - see below. Trump has a solution to homelessness - just throw them in camps! Superior policy chops with Trump. Or something. https://t.co/nwTiKcqMfC,1552322667209949185,UncleJneutron,1157141647672504320
"CC @Mystic_Mags - seriously, watch this.  Trump's brilliant idea for homelessness is to put them in camps, outside of our ""beautiful cities"". Like we saw on Southpark. https://t.co/nwTiKcqMfC",1552319483032834049,UncleJneutron,1157141647672504320

Wait...is Charlie's new book about Trump University? Because THAT was a college scam. Trump had to pay like $25mm to settle lawsuits. https://t.co/gTEws5tj3H,1552301896303579137,UncleJneutron,1157141647672504320

"@Jerry_ATX It's a bad idea *unless it is someone like Claire McCaskill doing it for Todd Akin. It's gotta be directed locally, and only if you are certain of the voters.
