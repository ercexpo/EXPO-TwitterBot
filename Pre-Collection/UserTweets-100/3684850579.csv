"Final: 2-0, @RoosFC takes down @LykanUnited in @OfficialBDSL championship division quarterfinals. Goals: Ndjibu and Reinagel. Assists: Tor and Ewing. I believe Roos face @BorussiaBees next Sunday in the semis. https://t.co/pxwhe5ymcU",1553912569764745216,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Goal, Roos, and that‚Äôs the insurance. Reinagel‚Äôs pressure unnerved the Lykan back line and Tor found him running through. Reinagel sliced inside and then cut his shot back against the grain to solve Philips. 2-0.",1553910576132358145,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"83‚Äô: At the other end, Slabyk makes his third big save, this time denying Flannery‚Äôs run behind that was spotted well by Will Smith.",1553910272628334592,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"81‚Äô: Almost a second for Roos as George Tor has a rip from Gaetan that forces a nice save from Philips. That was curling away from the former EA keeper, but he did well.",1553909990611722241,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Nearly an answer for Lykan, as Will Smith cranks the crossbar after running onto a loose ball. He struck it flush. Luke Lennox‚Äôs activity running horizontally across the 18 preceded that chance.",1553904975658582017,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Goal, Roos! Yanick Ndjibu makes a quick diagonal run and Noah Ewing spots it ‚Äî patient finish to the back post puts Roos in the driver‚Äôs seat.",1553902513069461504,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Half: Scoreless. Maybe it‚Äôs a microcosm of how close the championship division is this year, but I think one goal might decide this game again. Roos had a little more of the ball, Lykan had better chances. Slabyk key in that 45‚Äô for Roos.",1553898341116821504,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"After better possession by Roos and industry by Jimmy Hasselbeck, Lykan generates another decent chance as Jack Bean‚Äôs exquisite through ball to Lennox isn‚Äôt settled after a quality run through.",1553896258816937985,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"11‚Äô: Could easily be two for Lykan, as Slabyk pushes aside Will Smith‚Äôs try from close range after Luke Lennox won the ball back and served nicely into the box. Roos struggling to keep the ball for stretches - even though it‚Äôs clearly their goal to be patient and build.",1553891500131491841,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"8‚Äô: Slabyk stands tall for Roos! Smith and Griffiths combine well atop the box, springing the latter in on goal. Slabyk dives well to his left to deny. 0-0.",1553889679442837504,BN_Soccer,3684850579

Brandon Loncar gets his second of the evening just before the whistle for a 5-2 final. Bonetto did the heavy lifting after Bartlo won a ball in the midfield. Sharpshooters are onto the Tehel Cup final vs. Queenston next Thursday at Flash Fields in Elma.,1552841617928818688,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"There‚Äôs the insurance for Sharpshooters, and it‚Äôs just supreme from Ben Woolingham. He dekes in and out on the left before cutting back and curling a right-footed shot side netting for a 4-2 lead. BUSS getting tired defending.",1552838398158807042,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Nearly an insurance goal for Sharpshooters but it‚Äôs called back as the players walk back to center circle. Max Voyer is ruled offside - in front of the ball - after Lawler‚Äôs curled cross was met by Cary and nodded back across to Voyer. Amherst befuddled, still leads 3-2.",1552836648022441989,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"3-2, Sharpshooters, and we can barely keep up. Trevor Lawler has a try from the left side and it pings low off the post and tastily in front - where Max Voyer belts into the opening net from inches away.",1552834534969905154,BN_Soccer,3684850579
But resilient BUSS answers back off a corner kick! It‚Äôs a class service by Mike O‚ÄôConnor who finds Glorie Ndagano for the close-range header. 2-2 in what‚Äôs been an opportunistic second half.,1552832882409934848,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"2-1, Amherst. Loncar digs it out from two defenders at the end line, leaving for Loomis to drive across. A deflection finds Troy Jezioro, who smashes his shot by Tramuta from 12 yards.",1552832520546312193,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Almost the go-ahead goal for Amherst from pretty interplay. Bonetto carried 30 yards, then Boyer found Loncar, who played Bartlo through. His cross narrowly eludes the diving attempt by Jezioro to tap it in at the back post.",1552831741907406848,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Can confirm it‚Äôs Ben Woolingham on Amherst‚Äôs assist. Troy Jezioro with the quality to keep the ball alive deep in the right corner, though. Here are some pics to compensate for our uncertainty. https://t.co/VryLhke0o0",1552830625991860224,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Sharpshooters tie it up early second half. Good work from Jezioro and Woolingham to retrieve an over-hit cross, and a service back in meets the head of Brandon Loncar, who was camped out in the 6. https://t.co/AiTKlldQWo",1552829629869727745,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Just before half, BUSS takes the lead against the run of play. Ethan Grover picks out two runs through - it‚Äôs Nate Nuwer who gets on the end and rounds Petrie to tuck home. 1-0.",1552825794665320448,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Not much doing so far. Sharpshooters content to play horizontally and probe BUSS‚Äô D, but Clifford/Roach/Freitas have fared well against the few set pieces Amherst has had. Four subs for BUSS, looks like six or seven for Amherst. 0-0, 24‚Äô.",1552820765736796161,BN_Soccer,3684850579

"Off the post! FCY‚Äôs Chase Eagan drives a service into traffic from the right and Winkworth mishits his clearance off his own post. Nearly an equalizer. About 5‚Äô left in this Tehel Cup semi, still 2-1 QFC.",1552807128695508993,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Suddenly, it‚Äôs a one-goal game again as Lackawanna strikes behind Ali Alomari. An unlucky deflection following a corner sees Juszczak going the wrong way and the ball finding the corner. A bounce for FCY sets up an interesting final 10‚Äô.",1552806191381839872,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Queenston adds another, and it‚Äôs Trey Buscaglia‚Äôs grit in winning a one v one that leads to a tap-in by Nick DuMond. 2-0, 75‚Äô. Big defensive lapse by Lackawanna there gives the Parliament some breathing room.",1552805043673473025,BN_Soccer,3684850579
More opportunities falling to Queenston as we approach halfway through the 2nd half. A good double save by Catalano - stopping Kwitchoff and then Buscaglia on a juicy rebound. Here‚Äôs a Shawish FK a minute or two later. https://t.co/CPLLCLdudR,1552803203544223746,BN_Soccer,3684850579

"Each team trades a Grade-A chance before half. DuMond picks up a head of steam, carries 40 yards on the counter before laying a ball square to Buscaglia, who‚Äôs thwarted by Catalano‚Äôs strong challenge. Then Zak Shaibi with a burst of speed left - but his shot clangs the near post.",1552796308632702976,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"1-0, @QueenstonFC against the run of play! It‚Äôs ultimately Kwitchoff that gets the goal-line tap in at the back post - or maybe Fuchs - but the hard work was done by DuMond‚Äôs scoop to Rougeux surging up the right and a try to the back post.",1552793340277673984,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Nice look for Bryce Schiltz on his left from 15 yards, but it wanders wide of the far post. GK Juszczak urging his attackers to be more dynamic. And just like that, Mulderig slips in Schiltz, but Catalano gets out quick to block.",1552791739785691141,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"FCY still applying pressure, with Alomari beating the offside trap and forcing Juszczak to get low to deny from close range. Alomari‚Äôs teammates plead for him to pass the ball.

"Two or three glorious chances for Lackawanna aren‚Äôt converted - Noah Keem with a last-ditch block on Ali Alomari, then Mike Juszczak punches Zak Shaibi‚Äôs dipping volley over the bar. Quality end-to-end action early. 0-0, 16‚Äô.",1552788522813333505,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Best chance falls to Max Kwitchoff, who‚Äôs blast from 12 yards is batted aside - almost in self defense - by Catalano, who plays at Canisius. Queenston slightly better of play, but Lackawanna front 3 would rather play on the counter.",1552786734190104578,BN_Soccer,3684850579

"78': DJ Thiam is a wrecking ball on the counter, nearly leveling but sends her shot wide on a one-on-one with GK Dilling.

"Second-half thread: @FCBuffaloWomen trail 2-0 in the national semifinal. Serious changes at half include Erin Weir moving to CB, Maya Palmer to RB, DJ Thiam into the lineup as a striker, Colotti and Cutrona moved into midfield. Appears to be something akin to a 4-3-1-2.",1550959887257059328,BN_Soccer,3684850579
"Half: 2-0, Foothills. Buffalo conceding late in the half -- after nearly scoring at the other end -- has put the Wolves in dire straits.

"42': Wolves nearly level after Cutrona's through ball meets Rudney's run behind, but a strong tackle by Foothills' center back thwarts the opportunity.

"It's 94 degrees in Ludlow today, so two water breaks, at 15' and 30', will occur.

"5': FC Buffalo's Gurjeena Jandu is down on the turf, with the trainer checking the stability of her ankle. The center back is going to receive treatment -- unsure if she'll come off.
