PITCHERS: so much of your success lies with the intent behind your pitches. Every pitch you throw should have your best intent behind it. Even your off-speed stuff is thrown aggressively. A great way to learn intent? Long toss. It‚Äôs impossible to throw a ball 150‚Äô-plus passively.,991452748829876224,LAHS_Baseball,707076828402479104
