@vileplume_mz @soccercityradio The only thing that is irrelevant is you while you hiding behind a child's cartoon and talking out of your butt.  Best thing for you is to kick rocks.

Don't give words give action!! Definitely after you have the nerves to complain but want step up. Words mean nothing appreciation means more when you show it and not just blowing smoke.

I definitely will not be listening to @soccercityradio anymore. Nor should anyone else since the work that is being done is not good enough or appreciated.

Instead of Paying to come make noise and bring more to the game. Drive the atmosphere of the game. For Free but have the nerves to ask people to do more! Then see how you like it and what happens.,1550278185182445568,HCHS2000,276477381
You could just have a quiet stadium were nothing is going on. Then see how the atmosphere is in who's engaged!! The work being done can easily be stopped. Then be complaining about how quiet and dead it is. Maybe should do that anyway just go sit in the seats we paid for.,1550277079530356736,HCHS2000,276477381
We literally pay to come do work! To help make the game day experience better. Do you bring a beer or anything maybe come say thank you NO! Do we get any special perks or anything for doing it NO! So why ask for more or complain about people who are PAYING to come do work!,1550274581327482881,HCHS2000,276477381
The same people you are criticizing pay full price just like you to get into the game. Except for you sitting in your comfy seats complaining.  While they're putting in work and missing over half of the game. There is no discount no perks or anything like that for doing that it.,1550273359199588354,HCHS2000,276477381
Nothing pisses me off more than people who want to complain. But want step up to do the work!! Yet always want to criticize those who are working. Do the work and appreciate what you have!

@PhxRisingNation How many days of rest did y'all have? We only had 3 days after a tough game. You would have not even gotten a draw if it wasn't for Ben.
