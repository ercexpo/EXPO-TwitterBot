@VVilk_ @marialunadelrey Gotcha.  Good luck,1554556334749655047,RTCARDINALS,50879493
@VVilk_ @marialunadelrey And I remind you I did not reply to your tweet you replied to mine then complain about replying.,1554555634800009222,RTCARDINALS,50879493
@VVilk_ @marialunadelrey Yes I would advise you quit replying your showing your very insecure ways and need to insult to even make a point. Educate yourself on communication before you reply again. Itâ€™s embarrassing to read,1554555464255475712,RTCARDINALS,50879493
@VVilk_ @marialunadelrey Here is a few tips for you since your obviously the ignorant one. When you resort to using insults and curse words to prove your point it shows your argument is weak and you canâ€™t provide enough facts in a conversation so you use Insults to cement a point. This is where you fail,1554554334876164098,RTCARDINALS,50879493
@VVilk_ @marialunadelrey Nope females is the correct term. Itâ€™s the same when women say all males. You wonâ€™t see me saying oh my god a red flag when she says all males  come on man enough,1554551403493851139,RTCARDINALS,50879493
@VVilk_ @marialunadelrey Of course I do. Females is the correct term and I am sure if a man used a different term she would have a problem with that also. Thatâ€™s the issue so damn sensitive to the use of a word that is being used properly,1554551150774566917,RTCARDINALS,50879493
@VVilk_ @marialunadelrey You are the one who replied to me so maybe you need to check yourself about interacting.  Definition of ignorance is not knowing. I know 100 times more,1554550899321733123,RTCARDINALS,50879493

@jonmorosi @JeffPassan REPORT THE TRUTH.  @nationals played hardball with Mozeliak and the @Cardinals knowing they wanted SOTO. and the #stlcards did not blink so they took a much weaker package from the @padres #mlb @mlb,1554505865180356609,RTCARDINALS,50879493
