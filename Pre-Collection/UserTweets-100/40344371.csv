"@pimpinwear This is from SKor North.  but I like Bill Guerin's long play on the Fiala trade. The Wild continues to build talent and accumulate draft picks and, as Guerin said, that's how you build a team like the Avs. This team could be dangerous when its coming out of cap hell.",1542289289907666945,BillSexson,40344371
