@dskurnick15 I'll deal with the weak hitting catchers but Joely scares the crap out of me. Mop up role only. Hoping Peterson can make the transition,1554595369656324096,joeymonzo,48070493
@prominentplay If Jake is Jake and Megill and Peterson can improve the BP it will be fine.,1554594751923425280,joeymonzo,48070493
@dskurnick15 Trying to thread the needle between all in and long term. Playoffs are a crapshoot anyway. If Jake is Jake then short series are winnable. Want to avoid SD as long as possible,1554594346476847105,joeymonzo,48070493
@SheridanFinAid I'm hoping Megill and Peterson can be the BP depth. I have liked William's in the long role.,1554593516667355137,joeymonzo,48070493
@HighPointKing37 Didn't say I wasn't. I like the make up. Just wanted a solid lefty for the pen. Could be Peterson if he can make the transition. Just afraid of his control at times. Let's go Jake tonight.,1554593113569538048,joeymonzo,48070493
Mets are really good and have nice depth. But it just seems that they lost some ground to a few other likely playoff teams the past week. Time will tell.,1554591261213855744,joeymonzo,48070493

Looks like McGill is the big BP addition.,1554576986755833856,joeymonzo,48070493

"@JasonTrekkie McCann back soon, too.",1554575690665668608,joeymonzo,48070493
@JasonTrekkie Look at how many games catchers need behind the plate in the minors. He is at about 50%. His bat MIGHT play now. September.,1554575413354975232,joeymonzo,48070493

@CliffycLGM @RealGarrettCarr But they might want to add his bat when they can add 2 roster spots. But not to catch.,1554574368734228481,joeymonzo,48070493
@RealGarrettCarr @CliffycLGM Not ready to catch this staff. Maybe September,1554573732844163072,joeymonzo,48070493

@CliffycLGM Don't need Contreras now. BP.,1554569372395442177,joeymonzo,48070493
"@SheridanFinAid Yeah. It came off that way. This is a nice, deep team. Credit there. Still not sure there is enough power for October BB. So that makes the pen critical.",1554561816704974850,joeymonzo,48070493
@SheridanFinAid BP still needs help. I think it will be addressed. Don't need Contreras now which is good. Losing Robertson to Philly hurts.,1554560914644426752,joeymonzo,48070493
