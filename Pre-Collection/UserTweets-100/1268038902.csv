@AZbrewergurl @acwilber @AdamMcCalvy We`ve been seeing one since 1970. Jump on board people and watch them get rid of Burnes. Just a little pissed at this team right now,1554594541398679553,PerryClark8,1268038902
He was part of our Success. Did you here that @Brewers . You fucked up big time here. Don`t worry you`ll be next Devin. I`ve been watching 50 years of no Championships. I see the team who got Hader just signed Soto. Maybe it`s time to switch teams? 😡😡😡 https://t.co/Y1M2pxshAD,1554593984344989698,PerryClark8,1268038902

@yelichfans @5StarWhiteTrash Hader wasn`t a racist. He quoted lines from movies to be funny. Even his teammates said he wasn`t racist,1554322757697028096,PerryClark8,1268038902
@MkeBrewMike They can’t afford a good bat. We blew all our money on slap hitting Yelich,1554318248828497921,PerryClark8,1268038902

@TimElls1 @adamesfan27 Most knowledgeable baseball people love getting rid of Hader? 🙄,1554297052946989057,PerryClark8,1268038902
@AZbrewergurl @BrewPack8 Wong has an option for next year and I bet the Brewers don`t keep it.He says he wants to remain a Brewer for a while but that doesn`t matter to Stearns and Attanasio. Clearly fan favorites don`t matter to them,1554295879552667649,PerryClark8,1268038902

@Mrs_J_Bananas I was too but I`m getting sick of never winning which I should be used to by now being a Brewers fan my whole life. One of the most exciting things we had was Hader and he`s gone now. We also lost Lo Cain this year and never replaced him. I can`t keep taking these punches to my❤️,1554293804542398467,PerryClark8,1268038902
@jonmorosi @Mrs_J_Bananas 🙄,1554282455560888320,PerryClark8,1268038902
@Mrs_J_Bananas Sterns is not the problem. The problem is a sport with no salary cap. Dodgers spend the most money and they’re 35 games over .500. It sucks,1554282346794213377,PerryClark8,1268038902
@AdamMcCalvy @Mrs_J_Bananas Their goal is not to win a World Series. We traded away one of our 2 all stars. Our goal is to go one and done and say we made the playoffs again. See how great we are? Come to our park and spend money Brewers fans,1554281030730674176,PerryClark8,1268038902
