"Another huge night for the Americans in Eugene. 1-2 for Grant Holloway and Trey Cunningham in the 110 hurdles, 1-2-3 by Crouser, Kovacs, &amp; Awotunde in shot put, 1-2 for Nageotte &amp; Morris in the pole vault. 

And yet I can’t stop thinking about the Devon Allen DQ.",1548990671842955264,CoachDylanCSSH,887764616742416384
