"@jazzmomm Man. How cool!

Hopefully many to come. 

I played 8 years of football and four years of hockey, the only title we ever won was a postseason tourney for the teams that didn’t make the playoffs in football (I did play well tho) and a runner-up finish in rec league hockey. Cherish!",1550910527060094978,GrouchPotato20,818010392274223104
I have to just toss out there that my family is stoked to see @Joeingles7 in a great situation. I truly hope he gets a bite at the championship apple alongside @Giannis_An34 and gets a Steve Kerr-esque shot to seal it in game 6 https://t.co/sCuLRHrCq1,1550888785608511488,GrouchPotato20,818010392274223104

"@TheHoopCentral Nobody, genius. There’s only four of ‘em, and you don’t even need a fifth dude just go 4-on-5 with these guys so they only win by 32",1550848746065313793,GrouchPotato20,818010392274223104
"@Mavrik2190 @KnicksCentral You’re right. It’s the dilemma of having max contracts. Sure, you get a generational talent, but if you’ve gotta give Ainge your whole future to get it you might want to try the draft to get your 20-plus pt guy.

Trading the kids &amp; 5+ 1sts is mortgaging the future for 6 more Ws",1550845613347971072,GrouchPotato20,818010392274223104
You forgot that we’d also like your most prestigious local monument—we’re not picky. We’ll take your Statue of Liberty 🗽 or your cracked bell or your Abe Lincoln. https://t.co/yuccjgH827,1550843494008176640,GrouchPotato20,818010392274223104
"@HoboJ_ And this is a couple of seconds before PG’s cheap ass trip. Two injuries on that ankle made a huge difference, now Don plays below the rim and it totally changed his dynamic",1550842927819001856,GrouchPotato20,818010392274223104
"@HoboJ_ He didn’t sprain his ankle on Sumner’s foot.

Sumner leg-whipped him on his way back down to the floor. It was blatant. It was a season-altering——possibly franchise altering douche maneuver made by a drop in the NBA bucket, some 11th guy on the bench wrecked something special",1550842617587322880,GrouchPotato20,818010392274223104
"@Meech_2323 Down 2-0 with a healthy Mitchell and minus Kawhi, I’d hardly say the Clips had the Jazz right where they wanted em bro 😆 would’ve looked a lot different with Utah’s primary scorer not hobbled, so yeah that’s far from a delusion",1550556150713577472,GrouchPotato20,818010392274223104
