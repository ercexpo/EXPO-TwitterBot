@loveyoumake24 @lola_bluu I hope one day I get one of them hugs,1554550368150978563,bryankoval,18767960
I been thinking about taking a hiatus from twitter. It‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been as engaging as it used to be. Was a fun outlet to talk wrestling now it‚Äôs wrestling bashing for the most part. Will see though. It is Tuesday which usually is not a good mental Health day,1554530282350514176,bryankoval,18767960

@jerseyjoegotch Yes any control or change in booking you ask any promoter that‚Äôs the time frame to slowly make changes,1554179992908693504,bryankoval,18767960
@zheydorntorch @TweetsByVance For what it was I enjoyed it. Now Flair being remembered this way we all knew what kind of health he was in but hey he got to leave on his own terms with support from family and peers. The undercard was a nice showcase for other promotions out there,1554163552725995521,bryankoval,18767960
@jerseyjoegotch I‚Äôm gonna say this. Summerslam was fun BUT if it was Vince that has booked the same thing people would have shitted on the main event. The first 30 minutes HHH made a statement they are there but people on here over exaggerating. Will see,1554162273442271236,bryankoval,18767960
@JESnowden Agreed. Not every show has to have 4-5 star matches. This was like a build to the main event. MLW Impact and AEW all got a rub and a chance to showcase at a very important event. A strong show for a one off independent event,1554159709099331584,bryankoval,18767960

@JESnowden It was also well known at that Mania it was s forced retirement. I was still it still was one hell of a special moment. Tonight Flair goes out on his own terms,1553778314669658112,bryankoval,18767960
