"@RealPjHoops That can be a concern for big men in the NBA sometimes, do they actually love basketball or do they play it because they're taller everyone and it's their best chance to get rich? If its the later, then they they probably aren't going to be stars unless their naturally skilled.",1533819952188235776,crdurrett,1391708008032481280
"@guyncville @AirAlamo I agree, paying DeAndre Ayton the max is likely an big overpay but the #Spurs won't be able to sign him away from the #Suns otherwise. They can't offer $20 million a year, and expect the Suns not to match.

The Spurs could recoup some value by trading Poeltl afterwards though.",1533818476091121666,crdurrett,1391708008032481280
