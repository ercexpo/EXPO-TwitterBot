#blackhawks fans don‚Äôt freak out. Kyle Davidson is doing what he should be doing and that‚Äôs getting valuations on his assets. Nobody‚Äôs giving DeBrincat away. Someone most likely WILL overpay in a return. Find out what options you have and decide if it‚Äôs worth it. Good GM-ing. https://t.co/TCgJrbqTI6,1535350211010240512,TheRinkcast,855575486117924864
