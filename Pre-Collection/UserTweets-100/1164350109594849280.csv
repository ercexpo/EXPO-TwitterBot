"#DCSuperPets is flawlessly animated and downright adorable. The story leaves a bit to be desired, but it brings the laughs (sometimes surprisingly edgy) and fun, especially for younger audience members. #DwayneJohnson and #KevinHart are great, but #NatashaLyonne steals the show! https://t.co/OEw36OSyBh",1551731691928141824,GuyAtTheMovies1,1164350109594849280
