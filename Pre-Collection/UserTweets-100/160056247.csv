Don't talk about building a team around depth when you have 2 sub-replacement spots on your active roster.,1554596163248181250,AbeJaroszewski,160056247
"So Esteury Ruiz probably usurps Davis at some point over the next two months. That and probably Jace to take over for the third catcher finally.  

Maybe Frelick comes up late? 

Not acquiring even one MLB hitter when you have 2 spots just begging to be upgraded is malpractice.",1554595110049964035,AbeJaroszewski,160056247
@SpectiveWax they probably like the statcast in his side sessions or whatever but you CANNOT talk about sustainable winning and trade a 1-year reliever who hasn't thrown a pitch for a middle of the road prospect.,1554591607491526660,AbeJaroszewski,160056247
Let's build a sustainable winner by trading a top 20 prospect for a 32 year old reliever who was a free agent a month ago and hasn't thrown a pitch in the majors in 2 years. https://t.co/SgMEhPQsVy,1554587747494629376,AbeJaroszewski,160056247

"Welp there goes the Gallo dream.

The Yankees getting the Dodgers 15th best prospect seems pretty fortunately to be honest. 

Not many impact CF left on the board for the Brewers.",1554534709467783171,AbeJaroszewski,160056247

@JaymesL @bachlaw Harper didn't want to stay and Soto was never going to sign before free agency anyway.,1554498454973562880,AbeJaroszewski,160056247
It seems like a fair trade for Juan Soto and Josh Bell to me. But to then take on Hosmer is awful.,1554498011652407296,AbeJaroszewski,160056247

"@Rubie_Q @RDTopp @bachlaw They also took on money for this year so, sure, they are saving money for 23 but they easily could've done that in the offseason.

"Taylor Rogers is a solid reliever no doubt. 

His BEST ERA in a full season is basically the same as Hader's in his worst. They are not on the same planet as players don't get it twisted

Couldn't even ditch Severino's salary.",1554186616561967107,AbeJaroszewski,160056247
@eznark @RDTopp I'd take Brewers slightly but this is for like 26th place in MLB franchise rankings. The difference is largely irrelevant.,1554184174290014209,AbeJaroszewski,160056247
@eznark @RDTopp Yeah Jack Murphy Stadium must've been built on a Native American burial ground like the the Bradley Center was.,1554182642580557825,AbeJaroszewski,160056247

"@RDTopp @eznark having a bunch of veterans decline in their 30s as evidence seems a bit apocryphal to me.

"Just because guys are MLB players doesn't mean they are sure things people. 

Rogers is a FA after this year so they still need a late-inning reliever for next year (and this year frankly if they don't fix him).

"Hader's legacy in Milwaukee is actually an interesting convo. Quickly becomes dominant force as a bullpen ace but as he gets better decides he has to be used as a closer.

@jajareetz He's high on prospect lists because he might steal 50 bases which no one in the league does. Basically an infielder Billy Hamilton which is way more valuable in fantasy than real life.

"@eznark I think they 1) cheaped out a bit 2) panicked slightedly about the recent downtown and his lack of desire to be used non-traditionally when effective.
