"@BigRed_STL @STLFan81 @AZCardinals @Broncos It’s a shame that Cardinals fans never got to see a postseason win in St. Louis. Then again, they only got one in 40 years in Chicago before that. CJ definitely on a short list of “best quarterback you never heard of” assuming you’re not a Cardinals fan.",1540107051652751361,QBProjectBlog,1169435313418190848
"@BigRed_STL @jvhaas @AZCardinals @Broncos Thank you for clarifying. I wanted to use #RedSea. Honestly, not the biggest fan of #AZCardinals as a hashtag. Let’s see what 2022 brings from the Twittersphere!",1540106402336841728,QBProjectBlog,1169435313418190848

"@unamuno1898 @Saints @Commanders Thanks for the support and for teaching me something new! Kilmer didn’t have the greatest numbers as a Saint, but in their infancy he was really the franchise’s first primary QB and had to struggle thru the growing pains that come with leading a new team (just ask David Carr).",1539751342742409219,QBProjectBlog,1169435313418190848

"@IconGridiron @49ers @Chiefs Agreed, especially after learning how bad his injury really was (and how bad it got).  ESPN did a really great E60 about it. Amazing story: https://t.co/aAimIkA6Ab",1538693621846786049,QBProjectBlog,1169435313418190848

#81: A #1 overall pick, he persisted through a slow career start, helping make @49ers and @Chiefs consistent winners. Then recovered from a devastating injury to make a final triumphant return. #FTTB #ChiefsKingdom
