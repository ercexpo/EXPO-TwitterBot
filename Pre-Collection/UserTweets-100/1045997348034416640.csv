@scottsix Oh thanks good to know! Something about they wouldn't be ready to open. Honestly was on the fence because of the knee. Gonna call DLR and see if they can extend the stay for as close to the D23 rate as possible. Still got 2 months,1547265236629069826,SabinaNoRxp,1045997348034416640
Just got an email our reservation at Candy Cane inn was cancelled. Was doing a split stay there with DLR. That plus my knee being shot has me wondering if D23 is gonna happenüòû,1547240716837044225,SabinaNoRxp,1045997348034416640
