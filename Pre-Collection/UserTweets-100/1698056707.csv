Congratulations to @grantcohn on 50k YouTube subs. He has been a model to the content game in the 49ers community. Whether you like him or not he has most likely helped those you do like. Nobody does it like him. Happy to call him a friend.,1554602925648920577,JNay_LSS,1698056707

"My first takeaway from Trey Lance in person: unpredictability. He made throws from the pocket, outside the pocket, evaded pressure and scrambled. Defense made him earn every play. Highlight was a back-foot 40-yard bomb under pressure to Brandon Aiyuk down the sideline. #49ers",1554204584498941953,JNay_LSS,1698056707
