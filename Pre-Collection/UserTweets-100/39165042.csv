Fyi Black people don’t only like Blk Music. In my teens it went from HipHop to punk /new wave. I have in my garage 2 cassettes of the police punk recordings before they went Mainstream. I bought the Cd later they sound to clean. Also own an underground 📼 of Ramones &amp;The Clash,1554303586796015616,kathia_woods,39165042
Laura Nyro is a great example of a singer/ songwriter gifted artist. Other people had more success with her songs than she did. Many of your favorite songs were composed by her b. the average person doesn’t know who she is. Patti Smith is another important artist.,1554300854152331267,kathia_woods,39165042
Like my favorite albums top twenty include folks that are ok singers but the words and arrangements are amazing. Also an artist being popular doesn’t mean their great. Vanilla Ice 🤷🏾‍♀️,1554300054462136326,kathia_woods,39165042
Some of my favorite albums aren’t from folks who are the best singers but the songs are so great they have stayed with me a lifetime. There are legit people that think many of todays songs are the original,1554298897438220288,kathia_woods,39165042
