@Lakers_310 Made some room for the youth on the roster. Outman has been fantastic now it’s Miguel turn to get in on the fun. Let’s get it!,1554603311478611968,reuben81691,1393542794
Knew Friedman had something up his sleeve. LFG!!! https://t.co/zv1XsowEiH,1554602108480995328,reuben81691,1393542794
@Ethanshirazi24 Think a change in scenery will do him some good. Friedman knows more than we do. I trust in his judgement. Once we get healthy we’ll be good to go in the Postseason.,1554594843849998337,reuben81691,1393542794
Friedman must see something in Gallo we don’t. Putting my trust in this. Now that the deadline is finally over let’s focus on beating the Hated Ones again tonight! https://t.co/tc6zLupQPj,1554593738504019968,reuben81691,1393542794
@Reese_eeee You’re welcome!! Hope you’ve had a good day 🙏🏽,1554592918588907520,reuben81691,1393542794
@LBJAY__ Something tells me when Treinen comes back he’ll get the closer role. Kimbrel doesn’t have it anymore. Can’t throw him out there in the Postseason.,1554592581752848384,reuben81691,1393542794
@Reese_eeee Always blessing the TL hits different on you,1554592282782748672,reuben81691,1393542794
@Ethanshirazi24 Wish we would’ve got some help in the back end of the bullpen. Treinen is gonna be coming back. Gonna be a rocky rollercoaster if we continue to go with Kimbrel.,1554592050204422144,reuben81691,1393542794
@LBJAY__ With May and Buehler coming back the pitching will be fine. Just worry about the back end of the bullpen. We’re gonna get Treinen back tho. Key move is getting healthy and ready for another Postseason run in October.,1554591325454217216,reuben81691,1393542794
Guess that should do it there. Main thing is to get healthy and ready for the Postseason. https://t.co/PCJ08F8djk,1554590656235855872,reuben81691,1393542794

@eletrcfeels Lmao had to be said 🤷🏽‍♂️😂,1554588442368942080,reuben81691,1393542794
We need another arm to replace Mitch White just saying. In Friedman we trust. Still a couple of minutes left.,1554587215652458496,reuben81691,1393542794
Wonder if this means it’s making room for someone else being brought in 🤨🧐 https://t.co/duTAn69qkL,1554586648553213952,reuben81691,1393542794
Wish we would’ve held on to Jake Lamb he’s been solid off the bench. Could be setting up for something else tho. Have a feeling Friedman ain’t done just yet.,1554583646773751808,reuben81691,1393542794
@ZanolettiA Friedman knows reinforcements are on their way back. We’ll be the team to beat once we get healthy again.,1554563189957767168,reuben81691,1393542794

@LBJAY__ Typical Padres move cause they’re scared glad Friedman didn’t get fleeced by the Nats if he wants to come over after next season he’s more than welcome here in LA. He’ll actually win in Dodger Blue.,1554555522472235008,reuben81691,1393542794

@Lakers_310 Honestly an under the radar one too. He needed a new change of scenery and think he could help in the lineup and in the field as well. A solid Plan B option after losing out to Soto to SD. Padres looking desperate as usual lol,1554550308713295872,reuben81691,1393542794
