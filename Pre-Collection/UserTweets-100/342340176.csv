@KellenMarcil Hopefully. I told them I was willing to help but they were not interested. My only fear is that will the players even show up at this point. But I am hoping to put a few things together for meet and greets this year with some former players.,1547279558130520066,RhodyVault,342340176
Every Friar I have spoken to (on and off the record) can’t stop praising  @PCAthletics for what they do for former players. It’s not just events such as this but the little things that keep them engaged and honored. https://t.co/oCwTMO7rC8,1547277329537417216,RhodyVault,342340176
