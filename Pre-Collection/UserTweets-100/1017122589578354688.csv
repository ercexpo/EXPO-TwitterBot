Remember that drafting him is still a volatile proposition! We don't know what's happening behind the scenes. Make sure the risk is properly baked into the price.

"2 - The Video

I've talked about this ad nauseum so I won't do it again, but if that video leaks all bets are off as to what the NFL decides to do, including the possibility of the Exempt list.

I consider #2 possible, but I consider #1 unlikely (but a non-zero chance).

"1 - Plea Negotiations

I could see a scenario where the Saints are not in the playoff hunt late in the season &amp; Kamara has a reasonable deal sitting on the table. If he takes a plea at that point he could try to start his suspension with the Saints out of contention.

The case, in fact, is proceeding even slower than I had predicted as I thought after the 8/1 hearing that they might set a trial date.

As has been my position since the April continuance, I believe the legal timeline is setting up for this case to push out past the NFL season.
