"@sposullivan5 Everything that grows is a weed in my world, not in a negative way, just more simple. This way, when the gardener mows the grass with weeds in, if I just say he mowed the weeds everything’s covered. I like some weeds more than others😈😂🌱",1553193306376441856,KendallAnnCurry,3278744634
I hate when bath salts come with the actual herbal weeds mixed in. I’m afraid they’ll clog the drain so I have to strain them out.
