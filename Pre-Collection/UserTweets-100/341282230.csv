"@cheyennebecca Oh yeah girl it was all over instagram. Then I saw videos saying the doctor was abusive to the girls and all this crap.

@cheyennebecca Girl they stopped doing fillers and all that and supposedly Dr Newman laid off everyone. They refunded everyone. I think Huntington might still be doing med spa services but they stopped at all other locations,1552047136673476608,AerJordan_,341282230
@cheyennebecca Well I went to image center in Irvine and then did you see all the drama that went down?,1552045882257788928,AerJordan_,341282230

Brooklyn has me and Chris playing “office” right now and Chris and Brooklyn commit so well to pretending we are an office 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,1548163680939823106,AerJordan_,341282230
Chris’s mom is watching the girls so we can bar hop at Gaslamp and we don’t know how to do this anymore bc we are old lol,1547787681181999109,AerJordan_,341282230

@KarmaSkonka I miss you,1545703893912281088,AerJordan_,341282230
Aria is asleep and I’m bored and lonely. Birthdays aren’t the same when you get older and when you’re a mom.,1545617154644381696,AerJordan_,341282230
@cenayaadopee Okay I will try that next. She just fell asleep and I’m gonna softly move her into her bed shortly onto her back lol,1545610194289246209,AerJordan_,341282230

Aria must know it’s my birthday bc she woke up right at midnight and had a meltdown🙄🥲,1545309592317399045,AerJordan_,341282230
The best part of Chris going away for a bachelor party on my birthday weekend is the fact that I get the bed to myself (other than dusting with Aria) lol,1545258147190755328,AerJordan_,341282230

My fave part of wedding planning right now is choosing music! Chris and I are gonna have the best wedding playlist,1537825729919868928,AerJordan_,341282230
@cheyennebecca I like them though too 🤣🤣🤣 i feel like Pete must be a very charming guy,1537529382368993280,AerJordan_,341282230
I’ve come to the conclusion that I actually like Kim and Pete together.,1537462761545879552,AerJordan_,341282230

Everyone is talking about Amber Heard and Johnny Depp but no one is talking much about Black Chyna's domestic violence against Rob Kardashian. She tried to strangle him with an iphone cord and pointed a gun at him multiple times like wtf.,1519684629665443840,AerJordan_,341282230
@relizste Girl same lol,1519323055339675649,AerJordan_,341282230
"@AnnieBagnell I don’t think all mail places are doing gel x yet, but in my opinion, I prefer the gel x. They’re a little more expensive than traditional acrylic, but they are lasting longer for me and I’m hard on my nails!",1518706771338010624,AerJordan_,341282230
Today is day 1 of working 8 days straight 🥺,1518598089069588481,AerJordan_,341282230
@AnnieBagnell I’m sure a nail tech could explain better than I can but gel x is just like a gel like glue that hardens instead of using the acrylic powder/liquid mixture lol,1518419400986046464,AerJordan_,341282230
"@AnnieBagnell It’s like a gel that forms hard like acrylic does but it’s healthier for your nails. Honestly, it lasts way longer and seems stronger too. I still get tips for the shape/length but they basically press the nails on using the gel almost like press ons! Lol",1518416952015790081,AerJordan_,341282230
I’ve switched from acrylic nails to gel x and I’m obsessed. Never going back to acrylic 💅🏼,1518301470520930304,AerJordan_,341282230

@LyssMarieCoop I’m so stressed 😅😅,1517361418714066944,AerJordan_,341282230
