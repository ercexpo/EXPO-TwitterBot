We looked so good in that first half. I don’t understand why we shy away from it. Feels like we are so close Oscar needs to leave the bus in the past https://t.co/Eg4QMQDdTn,1553883556853735424,Cgoodwin188,1216037691386671104

I don’t want to be lumped in with the Pareja out bunch quite yet but man it’s frustrating. We get something going with this formation and are dominating the first half and we just stop at the start of the second. Just let the boys play we are so close,1553881917744898048,Cgoodwin188,1216037691386671104

Anyone saying this L is on any of the players who kissed good shots. We would have had plenty more of those chances if we don’t auto park the fucking bus like we do (and fail at) EVERY FUCKING GAME,1553880446567682050,Cgoodwin188,1216037691386671104
