@Josh96096872 @MkeBrewMike You have a billionaire as an owner. Mets will but players. Brewers can't do that. Epic failure by Mark Attanasio and the Brewers front office last two days.,1554593169983119368,landoc88,3225160493
F ALL THE WAY AROUND https://t.co/pZPQcc26XD,1554592587704680450,landoc88,3225160493
What an EPIC FAILURE all the way around for the @Brewers and there front office. Trade Hader don't spear parts and two lottery tickets. Don't add a bat to this offense. Mark Attanasio is turning into Herb Kohl 2.0,1554590213363695618,landoc88,3225160493

@beekay414 DAMNIT,1554303411318931456,landoc88,3225160493
@beekay414 There's rumors flying Antonie Kelly was involved,1554301573525778432,landoc88,3225160493
@BrewersOfMKE @BackTheBlue71 They just promoted Kelly. There not moving him unless it's for some who's under contract for multiple years.,1554300737999478784,landoc88,3225160493

@OSeb1 Did you see Josh Hader chock in the playoffs,1554176188024750080,landoc88,3225160493
Not pissed but the fact the Brewers couldn't get one of the Padres top five prospects in the deal is ridiculous. I.E. Mckenze Gore or CJ Abrams https://t.co/mXz978g1gr,1554169035339735043,landoc88,3225160493
Well Hader has always chocked in the playoffs https://t.co/h6C0EO1SIP,1554168407460925440,landoc88,3225160493
Mark Attanasio must be in save money mode. Omar and Kolton are available now too? Just trade everyone and hit reset button on the franchise,1554168042749415424,landoc88,3225160493
The Brewers not getting back McKenzie Gore or CJ Abrams in a trade is a monumental failure on the Brewers front office.,1554165920972554240,landoc88,3225160493
The Brewers couldn't even get back MacKenzie Gore,1554162852566810624,landoc88,3225160493
