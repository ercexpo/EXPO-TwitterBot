"@FatherlyHQ Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Tron and wherever I wind up getting hired I'll eventually put up a Tron movie poster because the story is about belief, faith, &amp; old school good vs. evil/David vs. Goliath.

But if I'm drafting movies from '82, ET and ST:WOK are 1-2, easily.",1546637971247534082,hrbalaba,1354644560
@BlumerBrandon @SNYRangers Flip Cuylle &amp; Blais and I'd sign up for that.,1546606234404536324,hrbalaba,1354644560
"Seriously, The Who's ""Quadrophenia"" is epic in every way.",1546326418023481344,hrbalaba,1354644560
"Here's a question Yankees brass must be discussing behind the scenes:

Chapman's contract expires at the end of the year. If he hasn't regained any effectiveness by the end of July, what happens? Waivers? Trade?

(I hope they're discussing this. Obviously fans have seen enough.)",1546309929761390593,hrbalaba,1354644560
"@StatBoy_Steven Honestly, given that he's a 2nd round pick with high upside and is a LW whose path to the NHL on Broadway is currently blocked, wouldn't it make sense that he'd be in the AHL in 23-24 anyway and ready to crack the lineup some time that season if necessary?",1546227600422469632,hrbalaba,1354644560
"@NYRangers Would love to see 2-3 forwards standout besides Cuylle and Othmann, since both will have eyes on them nonstop. Who else leaves an impression and is that ""first call"" from HFD?",1546140715633332224,hrbalaba,1354644560
"@itsmrevandaniel (Or...if wine is more your thing, sample anything on the Niagara Wine Trail. It's got something for everyone. 

I say this as someone who lives 45 mins east of  downtown.)",1546133343443587072,hrbalaba,1354644560
"@itsmrevandaniel Try some of the microbreweries because they are all over the place and have some outstanding varieties. (I believe one or both of Big Ditch and Resurgence are close to downtown, so enjoy!)",1546132877280264193,hrbalaba,1354644560
"@MikeVacc RE: the ""almost did it teams""
I'd add that the 2012-2015 NY Rangers did everything but win. And the 2014 finals featured several OT games. Sooooo close.",1546131726073839618,hrbalaba,1354644560
