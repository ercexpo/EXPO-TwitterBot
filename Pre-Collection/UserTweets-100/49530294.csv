"@Geetee_75 @Blitz_Burgh And we lost Hilton and Feiler due to his contract. Steelers have struggled with the cap since the 2011 new CBA. We never had any cap to get real free agents. So we got stuck with Burnett, Barron, Turner and other bad FAs.",1552847598733512705,Flipsteeler,49530294
"@catpooper @BryantTEng @MarkMaddenX That being said, Depot is the only place I ever read any content and it is mainly Alex or Scott (DTH and I spent time at BTSC together and he puts out original solid content.)",1552846669787516928,Flipsteeler,49530294
"@catpooper @BryantTEng @MarkMaddenX Last article I wrote
I was simply saying that 750K views does not mean that it is good content
I have had fluff articles blow up and good ones flounder

"@RonaldC48418610 @CarterCritiques They have only done 2 big extensions in the past 30 years at WR -- they are not starting with DJ.
They would rather draft WRs every year than going after Oline, ILBs and CBs.",1552815497112010752,Flipsteeler,49530294

"@chairmanMAO_92 @Alex_Kozora It is 2 practices and just 1 drill. QBs are going to get days off. What if an injury happens with only 3? Rudy is not making the 53-man roster. Mitch will most likely be gone after this year.
What is wrong with him being on the PS this year and being the scout team QB?",1552811531464716288,Flipsteeler,49530294
