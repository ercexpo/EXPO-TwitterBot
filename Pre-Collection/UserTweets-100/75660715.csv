"Attendance: 23,951 total",1553550704094101504,ScoutRipley,75660715
"The fans at Soldier Field are dying for a Chicago goal, but on merit it really feels like we should be 0-0 at the half. As it is, you just can not make mistakes against the Wave, and that's the difference as Shaw's first goal has the visitors up 1-0",1553544666074726401,ScoutRipley,75660715
It takes being a pretty incredible center-back to be noticeable as such (especially on NWSL streams) but the in-person Naomi Girma experience is something else. She's like three defenders in one out there.,1553543512095969283,ScoutRipley,75660715

"Bad giveaway in the back, and Jaedyn Shaw has her first NWSL goal! Against the run of play maybe, but it counts all the same. 1-0 San Diego #MKOT #NWSL",1553539548105277441,ScoutRipley,75660715
"Multiple people within the Red Stars have talked about how good Ava Cook is at her body positioning when she receives the ball, and that was in full display in forcing that foul from Girma (who has been otherwise excellent already) #NWSL #MKOT",1553538207744155648,ScoutRipley,75660715
