"For the umpteenth time this season, the Giants face a pitcher with an ERA over 5 and turn him into Cy Young. Giants vs. Snell: 6 innings, 3 hits, 1 run. I love the Giants but their offense is #theworst #terrible #awful #anemic #lame #embarrassing #thanksfarhan #thankskapler",1545614330984509441,RobertWarshaw,290181918
"Giants resume being terrible. 10 innings, 2 hits, 1 run. Their offense is unbelievably weak. They may currently be the worst team in baseball #sfgiants #terrible #awful #embarrassing #thanksfarhan #thankskapler",1545280671764975616,RobertWarshaw,290181918
