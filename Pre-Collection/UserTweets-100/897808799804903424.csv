There's still stigma and it's still something people live with. But now it's very treatable and there's also PREP. We've come a long way. But magic Johnson survived.

Kyler Murray as a person. It was a huge topic on ESPN only because they needed a way to fill time on it's broadcast so they found an angle to discuss a benign detail. it became such a problem for the Cardinals they took the clause out of the contract. ESPN did that.,1553121657396551683,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
"Was basically for people on ESPN to say that this ""4 hours of game film watching each game week"" clause in the contract is a sign that the team doesn't trust Kyler Murray and doesn't think he's responsible also ESPN people took the angle that that contract clause was damning for",1553121655999938561,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
They need all of the actual news that's out there but at these meetings they need to find an angle for their pundits to spend the hours of the day basically debating and commentating on because reporting the news isn't enough. The angle the ESPN producers chose to feed employees,1553121654607421440,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
"Benign about that being in the contract if I had to guess. This was reported on ESPN this scoop about the contract, which was already in the news.

I am a sports fan. Recently a reporter scooped that Kyler Murray's new contract had a clause in it he had to watch 4 hours of film per week.

An ear of corn and sell it for fifty cents and each tax day you put that money into their pockets and it is just a bit of a peeve that subsidized industry is charging more during inflationgate 2022. Republicans love farmers but they often rely on subsidies so they can profit,1552074420679856129,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
"The reason this is? Socialism. Yes the American government subsidizes agriculture heavily so our farmers can compete with international growers.

Wonder how far below the cost of production the American farm grown produce was being sold to our grocery stores that now costs more due to inflation.

But businesses won't accept telling their shareholders they're not expanding so instead of focusing on making a product more people will buy they charge the people who still buy more to keep growing it's going to happen more and more as time goes on mark my words.,1552056764593586176,ookiespooky,897808799804903424

Also things are going to get more expensive still because companies are making less money.

Had a dream I went golfing with lil Nas x. I asked him to give me a hair cut and then he said I would have to sign legal papers in case it was a bad haircut and his friends laughed at me.,1551582759314984960,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
My favorite headline I've seen today. Lol. https://t.co/avOEjwOQTV,1551377875483361280,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
@UberFacts 20 million$,1551284202838102016,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
@UberFacts They could've taken the 20$ and given it to rum Tum tugger and he would've ended the cold war.,1551284160316178433,ookiespooky,897808799804903424

Actually I think it was 20/20 not the first 48. I thought that episode of 20/20 was pretty funny. Hell maybe I should watch more 20/20.,1550997162355466243,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
"And I definitely have never watched a true crime documentary on Netflix or anything. I think it's a little bit demented everyone's into obsessing over murders. I did watch ""the first 48"" once and had a good laugh at this lady lying about giving her husband draino.",1550996742778273793,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
"I'm not into true crime. To this day I don't know what tiger king is about. A guy who had tigers and his wife killed him I think it could be based on just living but that's about it. I've never listened to a true crime podcast. Maybe about 5 minutes of ""serial.""",1550996741884977152,ookiespooky,897808799804903424
