@QuebexicoPats @SpodaddyJr @AdamSchefter Ask the defense and coaching staff why he didn’t make it last year. Bills most likely win the super bowl last year if those 13 seconds are different.

@dillon_cordial I think Watson should get more games for sure. But my guess is the NFL has already taken into account the year that he missed last year as well. And they should rip into that salary he’s getting,1554125922495877121,AM_Star5,375727431
