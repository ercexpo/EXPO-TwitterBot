Extend Bell and you've got a good cornerstone to build around. By trading him it just opens up yet another hole to be filled. #Nats https://t.co/4lSaKiArN8",1553119799617650690,BeardedFish927,487145617

"I don't want a ""realistic"" return for Soto. I want it all! I want a legit blockbuster. I want 4-5 of a team's TOP prospects (like literally #1 - #4 and all in the top 100) AND ML-ready guys! If Rizzo can't get what he wants, then don't do it! #Nats https://t.co/7S0Iq42q9o",1553077955752083458,BeardedFish927,487145617

Maybe I could get behind this. But I'd want Winn and Walker! The deal has to be out of this world. I don't want the Nats to negotiate and settle just to move Juan. #Nats https://t.co/EzmpmpzunC,1552724717135699968,BeardedFish927,487145617
"Sounds like a perfect fit for the perennial losing, rebuilding, trading away their generational superstar #Nats, huh? https://t.co/WMo13Snfys",1552646373392240640,BeardedFish927,487145617
"The #Nats would have to get Gorman, Wynn, Walker, Libatore, AND a few more guys for me (and everyone) to be ok with a trade like this! Throw in O'Neil too. https://t.co/Lx36JzjeDM",1552481157731819521,BeardedFish927,487145617
"I like comparing #AEW and #WWE. The commentary difference is funny. On any given move, Excalibur will call it something like a ""reverse 360 suicide fiesta cumulonimbus floopty-floo,"" and Michael Cole calls the same move, ""a throw!"" Lol 😆",1552445726214725632,BeardedFish927,487145617
