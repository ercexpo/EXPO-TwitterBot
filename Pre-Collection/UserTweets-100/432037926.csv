@Ivdown12 @ragazzoreport his peak is a worse version of Adam Dunn. His #'s this year are similar to Muncy except his OBP is less.,1554532908374716417,MatthewR2415,432037926

@DMAC_LA Itâ€™s a big 4 in both cases with Will Smith and Josh Bell,1554521484311203840,MatthewR2415,432037926
The 3 main players involved in this play are now all Padres https://t.co/WtskjzlhnF,1554516086707499008,MatthewR2415,432037926

"@Ivdown12 Padres just got the best reliever and two best bats on the trade market with Tatis back soon and while they (probably) aren't catching us, they aren't someone I want to see in a series tbh.",1554505728836063232,MatthewR2415,432037926
@AdamSchefter yeah but they only concluded that because they getting sued,1554505013040275456,MatthewR2415,432037926

@CBSSportsHQ @JimBowdenGM no it isn't. Lakers gave up more for Anthony Davis. Josh Bell is currently a 2.5-3.5 win player at this moment in the season and they get off Hosmer. Nationals got fleeced,1554502443999698944,MatthewR2415,432037926
@jonmorosi @MLBNetwork @MLB no one believes Eric freaking Hosmer would hold up anything,1554501436976742401,MatthewR2415,432037926
@DodgerBlue1958 going from a contender in a great place to live like San Diego to Washington isn't something I'd be willing to do,1554498404222259200,MatthewR2415,432037926

"@DodgersBeat that isn't a price. Bell was probably worth 1-2 of those specs by himself, Padres absolutely fleeced Washington",1554497723075739649,MatthewR2415,432037926
