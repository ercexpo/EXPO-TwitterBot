"The 49ers are going to have to either give in to just a 3yr extensions for Deebo, or go past year 3 for guaranteed money in Deebo's extension if it's 5yrs.",1552802807631192065,49erscap,984032060
"@ProFootballTalk They don't need to cut Jimmy to extend Deebo, they can easily turn Deebo's base into a signing bonus, they have $4.6M in cap room, add in $4.904M if they redo Trent Williams' deal.",1552801441357746176,49erscap,984032060
"@PFF_Brad I think if Deebo Samuel gets a 5yr deal, the 49ers will have to go deeper on guarantees, years wise.",1552799233148854273,49erscap,984032060
"@LombardiHimself I have them at $4.6M under, they can lower Deebo's base salary, enough to extend Deebo with that kind of a bonus.",1552798076414328832,49erscap,984032060
