"@NYCommenter @mikemayer22 Just Robertson. It would be cheaper. 
Contreras is not gonna come in and catch halfway through the season, 
So since he's basically just a DH, the Mets could find a better bat for DH out there.",1548437764491816962,shYNY_Yordy,975893334081310720

"@mikemayer22 Yes &amp; No.
I feel like you need a guarantee that he would sign an extension with the Mets, that's the only way him being 23 years old matters.

Otherwise, keep Alvarez &amp; sign Judge in the off-season.

Generational OF like Soto aren't as rare as generational Catchers like Alvarez.",1548368068903964673,shYNY_Yordy,975893334081310720
