"@rosebyan0thernm Like yeah going from a dirty tattered maid to a princess will help but you could probably still tell. But yknow what will guarantee you won‚Äôt be noticed by your evil relatives?

@rosebyan0thernm It also makes sense bc it‚Äôs the only thing he had to find her. And also I always believed that there was probably magic obscuring her face to be unrecognizable bc she wanted to go to the same ball as her evil family and obviously couldn‚Äôt be seen.,1553613785906040833,Paradox_arts,607649317
