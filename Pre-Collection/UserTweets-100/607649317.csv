"@rosebyan0thernm Like yeah going from a dirty tattered maid to a princess will help but you could probably still tell. But yknow what will guarantee you won’t be noticed by your evil relatives? Magic, from the floating fairy lady that just turned two mice into horses and a pumpkin into a carriage",1553614455224745984,Paradox_arts,607649317
@rosebyan0thernm It also makes sense bc it’s the only thing he had to find her. And also I always believed that there was probably magic obscuring her face to be unrecognizable bc she wanted to go to the same ball as her evil family and obviously couldn’t be seen.,1553613785906040833,Paradox_arts,607649317

@rosebyan0thernm I would also say it depends on if your mom is the questioning type. Like if you leave it out there as if you never touched it in the first place would she question you at all? If so maybe just go for the “u got melty package” route,1550216971517566976,Paradox_arts,607649317

@rosebyan0thernm Either say “hey you got a package in but the heat kinda melted it a bit” or just straight up don’t acknowledge it and leave it as is and act as if you never knew there was a package in the first place.,1550216392284155904,Paradox_arts,607649317
