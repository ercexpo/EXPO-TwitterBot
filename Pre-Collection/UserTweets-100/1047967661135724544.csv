"@Junefoox That doesn't make sense though. If their choice is keep the cages small or let them out entirely, they're going to choose to keep the cages small. There's no way we're getting from 0 to 100. You have to chip away at the cultural and legal blocks to animal welfare",1552367369108049927,k_sudborough,1047967661135724544
@Junefoox Pushing for these reforms also gets people thinking about animal welfare and how much they care about it without making them defensive. It's then easier to get them to admit they were wrong and go vegan.,1552356078515535880,k_sudborough,1047967661135724544
"@Junefoox Disagree. You have to begin to make cracks in the wall if you wanna take it down. By fighting for welfare reforms, you get the government and lawmakers to admit that animals deserve moral consideration and that their welfare is important. Small reforms pave the way for liberation",1552355752513339393,k_sudborough,1047967661135724544

"@FlamePanda87 Oh god you're braver than I. I got stitches in my finger a couple weeks ago and I could barely stand to look at it after it was done. Though admittedly the stitches were badly done and didn't fully close the wound, so it was pretty nasty and looked like a frankenfinger.",1552138009281269760,k_sudborough,1047967661135724544
