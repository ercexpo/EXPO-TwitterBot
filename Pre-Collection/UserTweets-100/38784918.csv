@_CharlesDiamond @AndrewMarchand @Ourand_SBJ Maybe Fox News is trying to grease the wheels for an eventual Fox or Fox Sports TV deal with LIV. My dad is a 75-year-old Fox News viewer.

@_CharlesDiamond @AndrewMarchand @Ourand_SBJ I don't agree with him. I think their strategy is to do as much press as possible and Fox News seems to be the only outlet willing to oblige.
