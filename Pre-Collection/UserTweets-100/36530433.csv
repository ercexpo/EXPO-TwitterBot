Had Red Bull got the aero regs right in 09. He could have been a 5 time world champion. It was obvious why he went to Ferrari. Attempting to emulate Schumacher but that wasnâ€™t the Brawn/Todt version of Ferrari. The move to Aston Martin showed flashes of what he was.,1552646309508780033,JoLeKo011,36530433
#Vettel retiring is a good thing. He was amazing good at his peak but since the blown diffusers went away. Was never quite as good. The mess at Ferrari never helped him much. But peak Vettel was pretty amazing. The win at Italy in 08 singled him out as a star.,1552646307390656515,JoLeKo011,36530433
