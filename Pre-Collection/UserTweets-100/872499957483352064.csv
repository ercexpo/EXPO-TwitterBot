@Tyler_Polumbus My rookie year I remember coach Reeves asking Joe Collier to take me off of the scout team defense because I was defeating blocks and messing up the offense's drill.  Maybe Josh should focus on the lack of blocking and the good containment by his pass rusher.,1553034479924662272,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064

Russian soldiers film and publish videos of how they mutilate genitals and then shoot a Ukrainian POW in the head. How is this different from ISIS videos where they slaughtered people in front of the camera?
