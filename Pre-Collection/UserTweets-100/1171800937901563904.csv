"Only one team wins every year! If yo team loses, you start making excuses as to what happened 😏 What actually happened was YOU LOST! WARRIORS HAD A PARADE AND IT TURNED INTO BASICALLY SOUR GRAPES EXHIBIT?🤔",1539102512791310337,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
@espn Warriors win the championship and yet somehow they sound like they lost?😄 Draymond Green is the epitome of classless means? THE CHAMPS DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING! YOU WON THE DAMN TROPHY! WARRIORS ARE COMING DOWN TO THE LOSERS LEVEL BY EVEN RESPONDING?🤔,1539101502136107008,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
@DrGuru_ Let's also remember KD chose to move on because he thought that the team had run it's course?🤔 He sat out over a year and when he did surface he had Kyrie Irving and they were actually on a collision course if they had got by the team the Warriors beat in 6 games 🤔,1537783212440801281,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
"@KeyJayandMax ESPN gives 3 idiot's a platform to espouse any narrative that will make you say WTF🤨 But if you look at who is saying the Shit, you chalk it up to ""the 3 Stooges"" of the sports world who don't warrant your attention 😏",1537764936906153985,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
ESPN is gloomy Friday folks 😥 They hyped up Boston as too much for the Warriors and the Celtics got Slapped in Boston like Chris Rock and ESPN didn't know how to respond 🤕 Mike Breen zeroed in on the 55pt spread against Memphis trying to imply they aren't what the Finals say 🤨,1537741628345094145,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904

@RealSkipBayless 😂 So the championship that Curry just won is generic? You know you sound Fucn krazy 🤣,1537650637814611968,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
Curry is straight garbage 😂 He can't shoot! He don't know how to dribble! The Warriors will never win with Stephen Curry 😂,1537641045609127937,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
Curry is a bad Man!🔥👑,1537638844987756544,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
Celtics came out of the East and I honestly can't see how!🤨 Warriors biggest man was Looney and Draymond and Bjelica who made me hesitate to believe that they could win a championship,1537636506625507330,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
22 turnovers and ESPN expect the Celtics to beat who? Orlando maybe 🤣,1537635918110138370,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
10pt lead in the 4th quarter of a must win to secure the title? Warriors momentum is on their side I think 😂,1537631215121047553,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
Warriors had 22pt lead and I can't believe they will let Boston play another day? Warriors would have to basically lay down with 5min left in the 3rd quarter🤔 It's possible but tonight?,1537626772879069185,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
ESPN is physically ill right now 😂 Boston is ESPN 😂,1537625371033624580,Michael06831406,1171800937901563904
