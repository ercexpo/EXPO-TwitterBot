@appleleef Eddie just laughs at his stupid matching curtains and wallpaper for ten minutes and when Steve asks if he’s done that’s when he notices the bowling pin and the framed car photo and he loses it again. They don’t hook up that night. Steve makes Eddie sleep on the floor.,1554599902851829762,__ChelseaLee__,97546785

"@letymustdie @sourspeaker Ah gotcha. I don’t know if I’d say they don’t care, just more that they don’t speak on it because it’s not a canon ship. I also don’t get the obsession with asking grace about it all. I guess because she’s an active part of fandom? It’s definitely weird. Just ship what you ship",1553879411644145664,__ChelseaLee__,97546785

I’m not adding any tags or show names or info to this thread because I’m sure y’all know who/what this is about. But I needed to speak as an actor who has had interpretations of my own characters and relationships outside of the canon,1553869582347239424,__ChelseaLee__,97546785
"When I played Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby, or#ur interpretation was that she was a closeted lesbian in love with Daisy, not Nick, and that Nick was also closeted . Does that make that canon in the Great Gatsby universe? No, just in our interpretation of it",1553869581034422277,__ChelseaLee__,97546785
Like in any show I’m in I can say “this is how I interpret this scene or interaction and it’s how I personally played it” but ultimately that doesn’t mean I’m correct. My director still has their ultimate vision and arcs and relationships.,1553869579557945344,__ChelseaLee__,97546785
Y’all do know that an actor’s THOUGHTS and OPINIONS on a ship/character/etc. isn’t canon right? They don’t make those judgement calls. They have their thoughts and interpretations just as we do but ultimately only the showrunners and creative teams make those final calls https://t.co/0TkMlHgtpa,1553869576399724545,__ChelseaLee__,97546785
