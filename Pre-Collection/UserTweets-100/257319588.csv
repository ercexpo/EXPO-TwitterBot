@lightstarjo @alphaINTEL a Valk main talking about “get out of jail free cards” is genuinely hilarious. self rez isn’t hard to counter pros/streamers just love to cry &amp; bitch about something new every season ie “we want a different ranked system” *ranked system changes* “not that type of ranked system”🤡,1554461625788276742,_TrevorHendrix,257319588
@ClaraATwork It was pointless to remove it. Maybe 10% of the time you had one did you actually get the rez off. The only ppl that are bad are the streamers crying and bitching (per usual) bc they couldn’t find someone self rezing on the ground loud af for 30 seconds lol,1554324829125353474,_TrevorHendrix,257319588

@UnnecRoughness Fym?
