Trea Turner should be the dodgers shortstop until his career is over,1554314630650028032,howie277,4472290101
@J_vnatt22 Your team and the Red Sox can suck on a big set of balls. Both cheated. I donâ€™t hate on them anymore but will never have respect for them going forward,1554314138343690241,howie277,4472290101

@AlTheBoss03 Tuck rule. Worst call in history. Raiders could have been a dynasty instead of the Patriots,1553951206292217860,howie277,4472290101
@numetal_moment @cellabella16 Best band ever,1553950023431475201,howie277,4472290101
@its_Roliena Get a Raiders one. Iâ€™m getting one soon. It is going to be the Raiders logo. Maybe Dodgers on the other arm. Never had any,1553948773369405441,howie277,4472290101
@Ivon__Diaz12 As long as you are happy. Thatâ€™s all that matters,1553939615228329985,howie277,4472290101

@tampaige Is*,1553231536287358978,howie277,4472290101
@tampaige Could be the next big starter. He has very good stuff. And Iâ€™d mentally strong,1553231504733519872,howie277,4472290101
@tampaige He has closer stuff but way more productive as a starter. Hope he doesnâ€™t get traded,1553230818683895808,howie277,4472290101
@tampaige Phillips has been solid. Kinda thinking May might be in the pen when he comes back depending on who we trade for,1553229720266973184,howie277,4472290101
@tampaige Hard to find for sure,1553229136415657987,howie277,4472290101

@DodgerJesse Feels a little awkward. A lot of hype but no real leads. Def some big names out there,1553164083406536709,howie277,4472290101
@yessiii_d I wonâ€™t make any more comments like that,1552863935753330689,howie277,4472290101
@yessiii_d Iâ€™m. Not a bad guy. Made a comment I thought would be funny. Took offense to another comment. I like the conversations we have had. Thatâ€™s all. I donâ€™t know you either. But i donâ€™t want to be looked at like a bad guy. Iâ€™m married with an awesome daughter,1552862662534602752,howie277,4472290101

@RodgersyDodgers U sweep the giants and face a shit team after. They werenâ€™t up for this game but hopefully they get it together. A lot of time,1551778642270851072,howie277,4472290101
@RodgersyDodgers Still is. Hopefully they grab 2/3,1551778359960641536,howie277,4472290101
@ds0375 Donâ€™t like it,1551778143526166530,howie277,4472290101
@Thencinoman Heâ€™s still going back with his hands while the pitch is being thrown,1551776185524391936,howie277,4472290101
Bellingers bat is still going back as the pitch is being thrown. If he could just stop that maybe he could catch up to these higher strike fastballs,1551775962869678080,howie277,4472290101
@RodgersyDodgers Hope so,1551773901365149698,howie277,4472290101

@DoyerGil I would say castillo and bullpen help for sure. Prob bullpen first,1551759974602342400,howie277,4472290101
@DoyerGil Both should be untouchable,1551759824295235591,howie277,4472290101
@Thencinoman Heâ€™s not garbage. Respect the dude. Still getting outs at 35. Iâ€™m 36. Thatâ€™s the stuff i had in college. Never expected to make it being a righty. He had a career. And got 6 Dodgers out so far. Good for him. Dodgers will score,1551759732410564610,howie277,4472290101

@bcua510 I hear ya. Iâ€™ve always had mine short. Like to get up and do nothing with it lol,1551028373413044225,howie277,4472290101
