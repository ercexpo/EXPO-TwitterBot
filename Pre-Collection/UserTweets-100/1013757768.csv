Guidry's 25-3 season in 1978 is a thing of legend. No. 25 came in the Bucky Dent Game. https://t.co/7NVceCIyLz",1546576170149449728,CodyCutter35,1013757768
"@SABRbbcards @SABRLandmarks Couldn't get it all in one shot, but my Kenny Lofton and Tim Stoddard rookie cards made it to the ball diamond in East Chicago, Indiana, where they played high school baseball. https://t.co/yJXLp22CnM",1546554568460345345,CodyCutter35,1013757768

1996 Metal, Ryne Sandberg
The best surfboard card since Tim Flannery on '88 Fleer. Even better.
When this set came out, it was like nothing 90s kids ever imagined. And we thought Finest was mindblowing!
What's your favorite Metal card?

1998 Collector's Choice, Ken Griffey Jr.
Not often is Griffey on a card wearing the No. 42 of Jackie Robinson, who broke into the Majors 50 years before the photo on the card was taken.
Reversed from his No. 24, this began an idea for Jackie Robinson Day. https://t.co/QHS0TcfvFo",1545903271725998088,CodyCutter35,1013757768

1990 Score Rookie/Traded, Eric Lindros
Huh?
Lindros, well on his way toward being a No. 1 draft pick in the NHL, signed an exclusive deal with Score. This resulted in this card of Lindros taking batting practice with the Jays; he didn't play for them. https://t.co/K5dzz2qXxI",1545589727398592513,CodyCutter35,1013757768
