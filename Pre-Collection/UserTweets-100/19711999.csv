When we were kids, safety was NOT a concern.",1549217364427898880,MICHAELMYERS1,19711999
"@YallWayTooSoft @J_RobackJr @SportsEnthused @barstoolsports Ain’t no doubt about that. Ha. 
I don’t want to get run by nobody, just to be clear. Ha!",1549215541583306753,MICHAELMYERS1,19711999
"@J_RobackJr @SportsEnthused @barstoolsports Again man. 
You didn’t say “the expectation was that I…”

We don’t know each other, so ALL I had to go off of, was, exactly what you said.  And what I responded to, was what you actually said. 

If you meant something else. Cool. I got no actual beef. Just reacting to your words",1549215377439297537,MICHAELMYERS1,19711999
@YallWayTooSoft @J_RobackJr @SportsEnthused @barstoolsports I guess 6’2” 225 ain’t what it used to be.,1549214844922089474,MICHAELMYERS1,19711999
"@J_RobackJr @SportsEnthused @barstoolsports I agree with that sentiment. 

But it isn’t “jumping to conclusions” when I’m quoting you back to you (by definition).

I…”went looking for kids like this to lay out”.",1549198599564791812,MICHAELMYERS1,19711999

"@J_RobackJr @SportsEnthused @barstoolsports Then say that… not “I looked for kids like this”… bc my gut says that what you said first, is truest.

"@MattManion20 Yessir. And I respect your opinion.
I just don’t happen to share it.

I’ll root hard for our team either way, and I’ll find a way to embrace him if he becomes a Cardinal, but I am not pulling for it as my take is that it will do more harm than good.

Just my humble opinion.",1549071370864443392,MICHAELMYERS1,19711999
