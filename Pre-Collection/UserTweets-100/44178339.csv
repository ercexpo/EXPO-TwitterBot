"@Cartoonbrains I'll always remember it as the movie the creators clearly wanted to be a ""meet the feebles"" R but ended up a flash in the pan who's who of brand endorsement that used the tragic tale of a real child actor to tell a nothing story with refs that will be irrelevant in a year.",1554596812815605760,Killskerry,44178339
@Iron_Spike My mom always told me there was Native America ancestry somewhere waaaay back in my dad's side of the family but it was considered taboo to even mention because they were all racist assholes so nobody talked about it.

@ChunkyThunda @MSeamaya @Gr0g12110 @mattxiv @Lily_RoseHeart Because of some cherry picked examples you found? Also I notice those are mostly European events and Europe has a much more relaxed attitude towards sex and nudity in general. Maybe we should learn from them.,1554258346609238016,Killskerry,44178339

@killerweasel Historically the reason vampires can't see reflections was because mirrors used to be backed with silver and silver purifies/is bad for vampires so honestly vampires should be able to see themselves in modern mirrors.,1553975593280057344,Killskerry,44178339

How come clothes appear invisible in mirrors when vampires wear them? At what point in the dressing and undressing process do the clothes disappear/reappear. Or...do they stay invisible once the vampire takes them off? I have many questions.,1553944747508568064,Killskerry,44178339
