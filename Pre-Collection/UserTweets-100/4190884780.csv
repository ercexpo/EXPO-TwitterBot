@gatorfan4life5 @SimonettiSource I agree....IKF is an upgrade at UT and a speed guy off bench to replace Gonzalez,1554544559669010434,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@GarysheffieldJr Not to mention fans show up late and leave early from games...less around to boo him if he sucks,1554541283779248132,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@mother3k @ABeltran1993 I agree... they're leaving by the 7th to avoid traffic...not as many left to boo if hes bad,1554537520280571904,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780

@BRappy55 Giants get Gallo and a few more...Yanks also get Joc Pederson ...if you're going wild might as well go full jungle cat here,1554485694885765122,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@Captain_Strongo @JoeyGallo24 I agree... somewhere it doesnt impact the Yankees,1554476411695554561,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@BSmile Christ I was 16 and cried ..hit me like a gut punch so hard i couldn't breathe..remember it all like it was yesterday,1554474742454910978,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@VonSteingrabber @BronxZooNYY So did I...I was 16 ...hit me like i had been punched in the stomach so hard i couldn't breathe..,1554461129136537602,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@BrendanKutyNJ No thanks,1554351115797422080,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@bbqbaseball62 @BrendanKutyNJ Ive been saying that as well,1554294287797469184,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@JoezMcfLy Clean inning ...be nice if he wasnt 3-0 or 3-1 on everyone before throwing strikes thon,1554290738543972352,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@TimGreg20 IKF is out of position as a SS ...will be an upgrade to Gonzalez as the UT next year when Peraza or Cabrera ...one of the Oswalds lol ...is the SS,1554288701492154369,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@YanksBar I totally agree....was just pointing that out,1554285725180469249,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@ChrisDaleWriter Hes walking but pressing when he swings,1554280742196330497,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@YanksBar And Loasiga has been better lately as well,1554278679810809856,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Looking like Benintendi is trying too hard...lots of Ks so far and one measley infield hit....getting on bade tho...relax my man  #SEAvsNYY,1554270053528477701,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@oshiartist I can't either,1554267439562620930,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Does anyone in the booth realize we cant hear Jack Curry?  #SEAvsNYY,1554265709714309121,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780

Get  him out of there ... About to be 6-4#SEAvsNYY,1554264670374137858,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Get German out of there before he bleeds this lead away #SEAvsNYY,1554261409189531649,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@bitdog0319 @ABeltran1993 Sale?..hes more fragile than Bird,1554126450286018561,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@mryclept Cant throw it lol. But I agree the guy was way too close...have a right to get your story but not harrass the man,1553870738775490561,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@grudz2 I agree but think hes headed out ...A's supposedly like him alot,1553869784353329152,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@southernyank3 @MLBMarathon Right and add some pieces and get Reynolds along with Montas...or even Murphy the catcher..be an upgrade over Higgy,1553869146856820738,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@jdun1031 Aren't we all,1553865860053434371,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@youthoughtxxx @BarstoolHubbs By play off time we migt even have Britton back and Loasiga looking better ..there will be plenty of options to close,1553864075595112448,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@frummiee @tiz71 Loasiga looking better too...Not worried about Holmes ..this is just a hiccup...pen will be ok...still have Sears and Britton is even a possibility and people remember in the playoffs our #4and#5 starters will be bullpen pieces ..need one more solid starter,1553863265649938432,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@ABeltran1993 Would love to but I think it wont happen till last moment ...hope Im wrong ...Gallo to move... Starter to get ...looking for at least a few more moves unless they both happen in same deal,1553862341736923137,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@rjpisciotti59 LOL,1553858861551026176,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780

@NikkiJB1975 Brewers seem to be interested,1553856672694734855,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@mryclept Luckily hes not there yet,1553855800250187778,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Atta boy DJ .....Lets Go Judge #KCvsNYY,1553855594712408072,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@rjpisciotti59 That would be 3/4 full,1553854158209536005,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780

@rjpisciotti59 Nope,1553850357931020288,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@FrankiesTwoLoud I don't think so either....lots on here do tho and I totally agree with you on the chemistry being so much better without Sanchez,1553849847555448833,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@FrankiesTwoLoud Yep.... he's having a tough year and coupled with IKF not playing the best SS it makes that trade look bad but imo Josh is just having a bad year...if he was hitting like he did last year for the Twins people would say it was great  ..no one thought he would struggle like this,1553848700727971841,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@pinstripealley Yep...even when he hits the ball hard its right st someone,1553847620099096576,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780

@Mikey_Hands Locastro will most certainly be back in September when rosters expand for his defense and speed,1553842793772089347,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@Mikey_Hands Or if Locastro is out of options they will bring up Andujar or Florial till then,1553842513601085448,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@Mikey_Hands Gallo will be gone by then with Locastro back and then Locastro out again,1553842175225520128,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@TimGreg20 Its a beautiful thing,1553840998769467393,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@Mikey_Hands When Stanton gets back i would platoon Donaldson and Carpenter and Lemahieu of course getting his reps there ... Donaldson plays vs lefties and Carpy righties,1553838846961483776,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@GaryHPhillips Or a we are getting Syndegaard premotion,1553827861345230854,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Everyone back off Monty ..we have a huge division lead and hes just helping us by reminding Cash we need at least one more starter ....Do it Cash  #Yankees,1553821483964694528,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@rjpisciotti59 Thats what I would do as well ...3b platoon with Josh and occasionally 1st or DH,1553544709964005377,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@rjpisciotti59 @lefftee Would love Reynolds,1553489289547235329,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@rjpisciotti59 @lefftee You and me both,1553489219267530752,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@rjpisciotti59 @lefftee I never said it was....just that I would like to see it....saw him in a spring game in Tampa where he hit a triple... damn that boy can pick em up and lay em down,1553487378509189125,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Still not enough....lets go Nasty shut em down now.    #KCvsNYY,1553467428377706497,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Sac fly works but damn we need a big one to blow this open  #KCvsNYY,1553466862972829699,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Good time for a BeniðŸ’£ #KCvsNYY,1553466388681052162,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@lefftee @rjpisciotti59 I tend to agree...love to see what the kid could do...and he might even hit better being around better hitters and watching the approach,1553465939282345985,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Big DP #KCvsNYY,1553462497562222592,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Cmon nasty stop the bleeding #KCvsNYY,1553462136986288132,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@rjpisciotti59 @lefftee I like the idea of Sevy to the pen...might be his best role even and don't know who we might pick up but definitely need a #2 type to partner Cole,1553460782087766017,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@JoeCanari No it didn't,1553460236102541314,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Carpy has been awesome with the bat bit damn I could throw better lefthanded #Yankees,1553450865524195328,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@JoeCanari Yep... going to bite us in the ass,1553450339088699392,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@demodisping And about to bite us,1553450134268166144,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@pinstripealley Like it..lets light em up early today,1553444464282181632,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@ynakhooda You mean Frankie Montas?,1553411438181498883,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@xiggy89x Yep...Yankee recycling at it's best,1553407137111474178,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@RyanLostinTX Never too old my man ..do it and good luck,1553382654996877313,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@ABeltran1993 Absolutely,1553381497507299330,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@JohnnyPayps @xiggy89x Yes and the NY market would make Ohtani a bunch as well.,1553378152877117442,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@Medic968 I would like to see that if hes not dealt...that at least strengthens the bench because IKF replaces Marwin as back up in the IF ...we have Benintendi Hicks Judge and Carpy in the OF and Stanton hopefully gets back soon so no need of Marwin in the OF at all,1553376021646278656,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@rjpisciotti59 @lefftee Maybe we can include Reynolds in that deal and get a true CF as well ...Hicks becomes 4th Of and Stanton mostly DHs when he gets back ..Carpy a bench piece,1553375101915103232,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@BryanHoch And 2nd baseman would have got there so 1st baseman should have stayed at the bag ... .but a W is a W,1553323949483753475,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@PrtyLittleGypsy Depends on the flavor,1553296300321513474,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@ABeltran1993 No argument about that...just not sure Cash is willing to trade Volpe for anyone,1553247318555631622,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@ABeltran1993 I'd be happy with Montas and Reynolds ... Soto is a one of a kind talent but if Cash wouldnt trade Volpe for Castillo you know he wont for Soto so we miss again,1553234263272734721,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@ABeltran1993 Prepare yourself for the we were in on some things but in the end thought the price was too high speech on Aug3rd,1553232044049719296,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@CodifyBaseball Cannon,1553228164918394880,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@barrypiatoff In horse shoes as long as your shoe can touch the post by turning it one length you can score if you have the closest one to it,1553227718325583872,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@barrypiatoff Or hand grenades,1553227252980129792,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Good job bats in getting this victory....shoutout to Milwaukee Cleveland and Derroit for beating Boston TB and The Jays   #KCvsNYY,1553210504746770435,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Cash u can go a long way in making up for not getting Castillo by getting us Reynolds to go with Montas and off loading Gallo #Yankees,1553208704002129920,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@magnitudeofme @xiggy89x Exactly,1553207335434199040,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@JoezMcfLy Does it really surprise you?,1553207208866897925,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@SimonettiSource Does this surprise anyone?....Cash presser incoming at the deadline....We were in on alot of guys but ultimately thought the price was too high,1553206884701814784,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@Chuck75100155 Yes ...would have been nice ...,1553206427115732992,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
@Chuck75100155 I think he feels too much pressure and if we get him a running partner he will settle down and be the guy we want him to be,1553205667757838336,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
IKF has had his defensive problems but has some really good Abs when needed....IMO hes not a natural SS so when we get Volpe or Peraza here hes the ultimate UT guy and with Lemahieu gives us huge versatility  #KCvsNYY,1553204882030661632,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
Not a hit bit we'll take that  #KCvsNYY,1553203998651473921,Yankeeslibero7,4190884780
