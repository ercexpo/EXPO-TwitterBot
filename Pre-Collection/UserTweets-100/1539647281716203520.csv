So… if I follow “camping” on Twitter it’s just all nascar racing and I can’t even let twitter know the way they show posts is absolutely bay shit dumb hahaha. I can’t stand this app 😆😆🤪🤪🤪,1551328147840409606,oftruenorth,1539647281716203520

I’m so pumped for this portable air conditioner. The amount of times I’ve slept in a hot tent or hot car is unreal. I got the smallest one they offer to test it out. Might go for the big one if this does okay though. Slowly putting together my adventure set up is so fun! https://t.co/YTg3vde6E0,1551306375057260546,oftruenorth,1539647281716203520

This right here is probably the greatest advice I’ve ever had the first time I heard it. Woke me up to realizing most of my suffering came from me torturing myself for things I’ve done or have been done to me and I’ve suffered for.

Obviously it’s a huge financial and time commitment to provide for these cats and to do it out of pocket every single day is astounding. If you’ve had a pet you know what I mean. Imagine 20+ at the same time and you understand just how incredible they are.,1550136730715623424,oftruenorth,1539647281716203520
I clearly don’t have a huge following on here or anywhere online so I’m not sure crowd funding would work. I make artwork so I could trade art for donations. I just wanna give back to 2 incredibly selfless people that have changed the lives of close to 75 cats at this point.,1550136346513121281,oftruenorth,1539647281716203520
"So my mom &amp; sister have been sheltering stray &amp; feral cats for about a decade. They’ve never asked for financial help &amp; have continually taken care of no less than 20 cats, usually around 30, that entire time. I’d really love to do something to help them out.

@Dragonlawyer11 @JennySperandeo @wakefieldreport Do you think Islands of Adventure hurt Universal Studios attendance? Do you think Epic will hurt Islands or just Studios?
