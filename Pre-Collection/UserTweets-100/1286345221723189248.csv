"The best way to grow hockey is to make it more accessible to play. The reality is it's still mostly a regional sport only rich &amp; upper-middle class families can afford.

There are 12 states with 5 hockey rinks or fewer in the entire state. That's a quarter of all states. https://t.co/lpDC6GZDHw",1554204102053097474,MarcelAndRogie,1286345221723189248
"@TripleCrownLAK I'm hoping both he and Fiala can match the years they had for sure. Prior to last season, I think Fiala was more of a 25 assist per season guy. Mostly because it's only the 2nd time he was able to stay healthy all season.",1554201654164987904,MarcelAndRogie,1286345221723189248

"@TripleCrownLAK As for Kempe's goal totals, I think people are acting like playing with Kopitar was some sort of handicap for Kempe, when he's been our best playmaking passer for about 15 yrs &amp; is an even better assist guy than Fiala.",1554198686527213568,MarcelAndRogie,1286345221723189248
"@TripleCrownLAK I think it will help Kempe's assist totals. He only had 17 assists despite being responsible for power play entries. I put a lot of that on Iafallo's lack of finish &amp; Kopi not shooting enough, but that needs to get way better if Kempe wants to be considered a true 1st-line winger",1554197752803778561,MarcelAndRogie,1286345221723189248
@blugrad @OilerAnalytics Jack Campbell's stats last season ended up being pretty comparable to Mike Smith's despite Soupy having Vezina numbers in the 1st half. Soupy totally fell apart in the 2nd half &amp; that was on a better all-around team IMHO. Soupy isn't gonna get much help on D in EDM. We'll see.,1554196812025585664,MarcelAndRogie,1286345221723189248
@TripleCrownLAK That's a bunch-o-goals. Even Ziggy P√°lffy couldn't hit 40 for us. That's a big ask.,1554195757124558849,MarcelAndRogie,1286345221723189248
"@blugrad @OilerAnalytics That's what people said when they signed him in the 1st place. It's actually pretty incredible how well he played with all that noise around him.

I don't think Soupy is an upgrade over what Mike Smith did. Especially after his 2nd half meltdown. He's either very good or very bad",1554193555974868992,MarcelAndRogie,1286345221723189248
