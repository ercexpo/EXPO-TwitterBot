It’s really strange how the cubs treated Contreras. The deadline clearly hung over him all season and the org let him dangle as he seemed to prepare for his final days as a cub just to not trade him.,1554590262277689345,SMines57,45608019
Idk how much actual involvement that old crank sandy has in making trades nowadays but feel like him whining about last years deadline was an obvious precursor for the Mets being slower at this one. Glad it’s over now though and we can focus fully on the season at hand.,1554589840049586176,SMines57,45608019
I think the Mets ultimately addressed some of their issues but certainly not all of them. It was an underwhelming deadline for an organization with its best team in almost 40 years but at least they didn’t do nothing.,1554588687744339973,SMines57,45608019
