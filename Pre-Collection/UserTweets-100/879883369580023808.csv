My conclusion @MindOfHoops,1554496063029088256,NoLayups_,879883369580023808
"Overall, I do think Kobe was better slightly (maybe, as not as much as I initially did). Though, they are on the same tier. I do see the lens where you could, be lower on Kobe O (without also boosting his D) &amp; thinking he was a negative off-ball that year.  To have Wade&gt;",1554495970414673920,NoLayups_,879883369580023808
"If I could put their defenses in Corp terms

Wade would be a .75 (I feel firmly on this)

With Kobe having a .35 for me with a range up to .5 (though you'll have to tax his O some if you think he's this high?",1554495889099694080,NoLayups_,879883369580023808
"Wade on defense was very fun this year, it was spectacular. He was first-team caliber in my eyes, high second team for sure. He was amazing off-ball in the passing lanes (passing deterrence), secondary rim protection, &amp; was good on the ball. An all-out great defensive year",1554495815523115008,NoLayups_,879883369580023808
"On the defensive end, there are two ends with Kobe guys that underrate him being that he couldn't be at his Shaq form on D (motor/load), but then again the tape doesn't lie. Overall, I think he was that next tier under all defensive level to arguably second all NBA D(maybe?)",1554495766072369152,NoLayups_,879883369580023808
"When considering Kobe's offense &amp; also off-ball ability I do give him a clean advantage on O 

Corp guys 5.5 vs 5.15 (one may argue I may have Kobe O a tad high could be more 5.35 vs 5.5, but I feel I also gave Wade the same advantage in what I value on O. https://t.co/NtozcmbjBG",1554495635642109954,NoLayups_,879883369580023808
"Far as playmaking they both had great playmaking seasons, with Kobe drawing tons of attention with being able to pull off any shot anytime &amp; Wade with his rim pressure. I think Wade has a playmaking advantage here with his rim pressure bending defenses a tad more &amp; passing",1554495475776110596,NoLayups_,879883369580023808
"Let's start with scoring, as GREAT as Wade's scoring was, Kobe's was just on another historical level that many people in the history of the game can't compete with. What did shock me was their FTA being on similar levels 13.2 vs 13.5(Wade)",1554495330686828544,NoLayups_,879883369580023808
