@madswee @jdotold ugh I do. funnily I've ALWAYS believed that pitchers should just all go 3-4 innings and be SP/middle relief/closers so that it elongates their careers and now that I'm actually seeing it I need... some time to get used to it in practice lol,1554520726824046592,thefriscobay,391823054

@madswee @jdotold I think outside of experienced fielders who can hit and won't commit as many errors (lol) our biggest gap is relief pitching at this point. a starter who could go deep or a reliever who can be relied on for 3-4 innings would be IDEAL,1554519858473082880,thefriscobay,391823054
