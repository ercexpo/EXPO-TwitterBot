@life_cavs @DevaronPerry This is a common misconception. Not sure where it started but as of right now they don‚Äôt have that kind of space and if Collin agrees to a multi-year deal it‚Äôs even further from the truth.,1554581873602359296,baclap,177429890
"@DevaronPerry I took a deeper look at this and although it‚Äôs not true that the Cavs have space to sign LeBron they could get there pretty easily. My assumption was always that this can‚Äôt be the Cavs Plan A. If he asks to come here they can make it happen though.

The fact that as of today no team in the NBA has formerly made an offer to Sexton that has forced the Cavs to exercise their right of first refusal does not mean there is no market for him in the NBA.,1554477930679791620,baclap,177429890

"After giving this some thought it‚Äôs really not that difficult to do what‚Äôs described here. If LeBron asks to come back I assume they do it, and they can keep all key players too. Cavs have a bright future with or without him though, so I don‚Äôt think this is Plan A internally. https://t.co/SOdkuUzQBk",1553882386005311488,baclap,177429890
"@DeanBricker1 They‚Äôd still need to create the $45M in space next offseason even if he‚Äôs on a shorter deal. It‚Äôs possible, but my point is that we don‚Äôt just have the space available without some effort. The ‚Äúmassive amount‚Äù of space they currently have is not massive by 2023 standards.",1553852263801597952,baclap,177429890
@DeanBricker1 Could very well be the case. Cap situation for next offseason would be the same though of course.,1553849250496188416,baclap,177429890
"So there you have it. The Cavs do have some cap space next offseason but not exactly LeBron cap space, and if Sexton is on a multi-year deal it gets even more difficult to manage. I would assume this is not a major component of Koby‚Äôs 5-year plan.",1553845959888478208,baclap,177429890
"So with the roster down to‚Ä¶

DG
Evan
JA
Lauri
Rubio
Agbaji

‚Ä¶they‚Äôre about $5M away from the required $45.42M of space. Rubio will be making $6.15M so if they offload his salary in a trade they can create the necessary space.",1553845958680539136,baclap,177429890
So the Cavs are pretty far off in terms of the space they‚Äôll have. The easiest routes to create more room would be to decline Okoro and Stevens‚Äôs team options (or trade them to a team with cap space for no money i.e. picks in return). This brings them to $40.13M in space.,1553845957707456512,baclap,177429890
Notably this does not include Sexton. If he leaves this offseason or takes the QO and leaves next offseason then nothing changes. If he signs a multi-year deal with the Cavs then the room they have next offseason is reduced by his next year‚Äôs salary.,1553845956705079297,baclap,177429890
So do the Cavs have the required $45.42M cap space? Here is the 23-24 season cap sheet as of today. That totals at $107.22M and with the projected cap being $129.78M that means $22.56M of space. Cedi‚Äôs contract is non-guaranteed so w/ all due respect we can just call it $29.28M. https://t.co/LxpvTQ9x12,1553845954926616576,baclap,177429890
This brings to light the fact that even if LeBron chooses not to extend right now he can come to an even longer and more lucrative agreement with the Lakers next summer. So it should not be taken as a clear indication he plans to leave.,1553845951487324160,baclap,177429890
