@DBCooperPodcast @netflix If I had to guess it's someone who's jealous your on Netflix and they're not,1549195573693075457,houseofmcgoo,66756690
@DBCooperPodcast the reviews on IMDB for the @netflix documentary are horrible! There is one that talks about your hair. You have to do a podcast talking about this documentary!! #DBCooper,1549187062502371329,houseofmcgoo,66756690
Just finished the DB Cooper documentary from @netflix and all I can say is that 3+ hours of my life I'll never get back. If you really want to learn about DB Cooper check out @DBCooperPodcast he does a much better job! There was only about 20 mins of the Netflix doc I enjoyed,1548801510120644608,houseofmcgoo,66756690
@DBCooperPodcast am I the only one who's upset they spent so much time on RR on the new @netflix documentary about DB Cooper?!? They could have told that part of the story in 15 mins. He WAS 28!! #DBCooper,1548715766194745344,houseofmcgoo,66756690

@DBCooperPodcast Love the podcast but this is just the nosy neighbor who doesn't have anything better to do.  I have an old neighbor that's meticulous too I think he might be DB Cooper but I'm not sure if https://t.co/NY3xLFliUh will have all the answers. ðŸ¤•  Not my favorite episode,1451324006536155140,houseofmcgoo,66756690
