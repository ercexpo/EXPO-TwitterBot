"@StLouieSports @Forever_Cards Would depend on the faith within the farm...

LAD is loaded with arms - if they have faith in guys like Stone, Knack, etc to be able to handle the pressure out of the pen as long men, the club might not care.

Staff is still: Kershaw, Urias, Gonsolin, Anderson

Walker back in Sep",1553933437710479360,KleinbergWyatt,1062817087167455232

"@FerronRyan @FutureDodgers I think its strange because that type of deal is a tip toe between getting max value and retooling... Maybe just aim for a solid A+/AA prospect as main piece w a couple of ceiling plays. 

Ex (LAD): Sheehan, Galiz, Doncon",1553929521866231808,KleinbergWyatt,1062817087167455232
