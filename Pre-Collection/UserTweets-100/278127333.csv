@wizkylifa11 Doesn’t hurt their chances but anyone that saw that Braves World Series run will tell you how valuable bullpen pitching is in regards to advancing in the playoffs. It would had made more sense if it was big time bat or starting pitcher that would contribute right away.,1554204790636298241,Jut_N14,278127333
Milwaukee traded their ⭐️ closer while leading their division against a possible playoff opponent for MILB players who aren’t going to help their team this year.

@baldheaded1der @TylerSmiley10 @DWilliamsWJCL22 Oh yeah I know we all for the same team haha I just don’t see an outside solution to 2nd at the moment and really hope Grissom is considered untouchable in any trade scenario,1553510324019535890,Jut_N14,278127333
"@baldheaded1der @TylerSmiley10 @DWilliamsWJCL22 It’s all dependent on Oz. There are more and more teams going straight from AA now.

@jase1129 Shewmake as he stands currently has higher MTV than Joc and Syndergard. I think he gets sent off for one of those. Are possibly Gallo which I am not in favor of that deal getting done,1553143678222352385,Jut_N14,278127333
@jase1129 I say Shewmake is the odd man out. Grissom stays and will be the number 1 prospect next year out of the Braves system. Have to hold on to him and see where contract negotiations go with Dansby,1553141733214634004,Jut_N14,278127333
