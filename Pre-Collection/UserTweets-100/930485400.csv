Idk why James Jones still hasn‚Äôt re-signed Ish yet.,1548119054455431168,PrimeDBook,930485400
@NetsLink Probably but there were so little teams that wanted him. Pacers were the only one to actually have a meeting with him.,1548003913701330945,PrimeDBook,930485400
@NetsLink Pacers offered Turner and Suns didn‚Äôt want him. So they grew impatient and decided to just throw an offer sheet.,1548001929086652418,PrimeDBook,930485400
@NetsLink That asset would‚Äôve been Myles Turner. This deal ain‚Äôt breaking off bc of him.,1547999455575621633,PrimeDBook,930485400
Why does Woj never mention how the Nets never even wanted Ayton? https://t.co/DebexdWo0D,1547997333568118785,PrimeDBook,930485400
@scooperhoops Literally the first day of free agency ESPN was calling Ayton an average center bc of the KD rumors and how he‚Äôs not enough to get him.,1547939054427115535,PrimeDBook,930485400
I hope Monty and Ayton do rekindle their relationship cause I would like him to stay more than 1 year with this extension. I‚Äôm tired having to go through every deadline with Ayton for Sabonis rumors.,1547782230356832259,PrimeDBook,930485400
I still can‚Äôt believe that Ayton is somehow back on the Suns lol,1547780480610684928,PrimeDBook,930485400
Hmm https://t.co/T5Ujxj3XfN,1547780357537181698,PrimeDBook,930485400
So is James Jones gonna personally fly him back? https://t.co/FYbIWMogBm,1547762003002871811,PrimeDBook,930485400
@AJMoMed If the weeks keep passing by it will. Cause KD doesn‚Äôt want to play anywhere else but here. If there are better packages than ours it would‚Äôve been accepted. But his team is probably telling them I won‚Äôt play there.,1547742069430505473,PrimeDBook,930485400
So this means Mikal and Cam are most likely gone if they still going after KD.,1547741039020019713,PrimeDBook,930485400
"I have one suggestion for Ayton and it‚Äôs for him to change his jersey number.

"Y'all got to stop saying Ayton had a better offensive game with Rubio. Just bc his ppg was higher, doesn't mean he was the second coming of David Robinson. When you rewatch 2019-20 highlights DA is scoring the same way with he does with CP3 feeding him.",1547711651339612162,PrimeDBook,930485400
