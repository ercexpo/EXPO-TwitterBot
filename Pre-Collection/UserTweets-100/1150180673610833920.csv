Sure, provided your definition is a high body count and 0 clue how to get a girl off.  He's not really concerned @ that either- I mean... sex is over once he gets his.

I think all of us who knew @ it suspected this day would come (assuming the intel is accurate.)  He was never her 1st choice.  Someone from EXO was.  He was who she settled for.  That's not a good thing.

They're 1/2 right.  They lack an understanding how fame/$$ doesn't imply Famous Idol XYZ has a gf to whom he's faithful.  Such is the case here- Ik there is a chick.

He's unmarketable.  The goal of ever being famous anywhere else outside of Asia?  Over.  His fanbase= teenagers discovering the genre for the 1st time + creepy noona/uncle fans, unwilling to accept 2012 was a decade ago.

It's common to see XYZ idol hook up w/ a non famous staff girl.  In his case (keeping in mind I haven't heard this specifically), I'm skeptical.  We're talking @ his trainer.

Hello right back Sweetheart, hope you are doing well too. 🥰

Idk to what degree he's unhappy, but given his backstory (underground rapper), it makes sense to me.  When he was here last, all he did was work work work.  Alone.
