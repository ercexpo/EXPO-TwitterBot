"@Conserned10 US differently needs to focus on helping those imprisoned in America out for THC products, rather than hypocritically trying to prison break Brittney Griner. Or simultaneously help them all out. I read that they said they would exchange an armed trafficker for Brittney. Crazy.",1552785516470276097,DevDock,967384015
"They got Brittney Griner on the cover of #Times magazine like she's Rosa Parks or Harriet Tubman. They called her a freedom fighter for smuggling weed oil in another country, illegally. Make it make sense.",1552783673484660737,DevDock,967384015

"@JP3Visualz That contradicts what Lebron wants because he wants to play more off the ball at this point to preserve his career. That's the reason why he shot more 3's last season. Why we traded for Denis and Russ, another and elite playmaker to take the ball out of Bron's hands.",1552768429215518720,DevDock,967384015
