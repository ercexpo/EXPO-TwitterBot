‚ÄúAdvanced-economic countries such as Canada‚Äù Universal healthcare and quality education are available everywhere.

@JPMendelson It would represent more people ideally. It would allow the Democrats to be the Centrists and the new party could be the Lefties.

@LevityDaremore It‚Äôs a risk I know to split the vote on the left. If a third party could appeal to Trump voters as well it may be possible. A more representative democracy would be ideal of course.
