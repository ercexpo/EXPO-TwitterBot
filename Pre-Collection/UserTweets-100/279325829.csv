@hiramboyd @TheCESlay @CLETommy @Kev_v8 @MiIlsWrld It‚Äôs entirely dependent on the individual guards themselves and whether or not they are good defenders though. Lowry and VanVleet were better defensively than the duo of DG and Sexton but DG and Sexton are better offensively IMO. It‚Äôs all about balance.,1554269018265100289,DevaronPerry,279325829

"@hiramboyd @TheCESlay @CLETommy @Kev_v8 @MiIlsWrld Yes, it can be done and I think the Cavs can do it. It‚Äôs just traditionally easier to game plan for defensively.

@hiramboyd @TheCESlay @CLETommy @Kev_v8 @MiIlsWrld I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs THE issue but rather something that‚Äôs easier to attack. That said it totally depends upon the makeup of the rest of the roster and the individual starts themselves at both guard spots.
