@brooklynnets85 I wouldn’t bank on that player actually being on the market for as long as it takes to make up your mind if you’re Sean Marks…,1552063127008821248,DirtyDozenPels,1421474150519083008

@brooklynnets85 I just could never imagine convincing myself of this idea that a hall of famer with a legacy to worry about - is going to literally set fire to all of that &amp; just refuse to play unless he’s traded to my favorite team - without hearing those exact words come out of his mouth.,1551977719377924097,DirtyDozenPels,1421474150519083008

"@brandonpickem @Dom_Ciccaglione Dude literally IMPLODES about the fact that he’s being told “the Nets don’t want your trade package” &amp; that KD would have to go nuclear for the Suns to land him. Lol

"@brandonpickem @Dom_Ciccaglione He’s really mad about the mere fact that the Suns don’t have the best package for a Kevin Durant trade &amp; that Kevin Durant isn’t just going to retire if he doesn’t get sent to PHX…
