The #Mets not getting any real help today has dampened my joy of watching #Degrom pitch tonight. Pissed. #LGM,1554609325360005120,mofunky77,51243568
@JoePantorno I believe nothing when it comes to #Isles free agenr rumors.,1554606492090830848,mofunky77,51243568
@phins48 @AnthonyDiComo Ok. Ill add probably. I dont think they resign him. Too injury prone for 35 million plus a year.,1554603360254296070,mofunky77,51243568
@AnthonyDiComo He's going to use the BS line of deGrom is are big addition. Could be the last year of having Scherzer and deGrom together and didnt go for it. Ridiculous,1554603053344608257,mofunky77,51243568
@Chickendirt @macrobubble First rd losses every year.,1554596952452595713,mofunky77,51243568
@Chickendirt @macrobubble Hes been terrible. Plain and simple,1554596859712241674,mofunky77,51243568
@AnthonyDiComo The last season with both deGrom and Scherzer and the #Mets do NOTHING at the deadline to improve. Embarrassing management by the #LGM,1554594487393030144,mofunky77,51243568
Billy Eppler should be fired. I don't care what he did with @StevenACohen2 money this off-season he screwed the #Mets today. Last go around with deGrom and Scherzer both on the team and you add NOTHING !!!! U blew it!!!! #LGM,1554592560462680065,mofunky77,51243568
I guess Billy Eppler just wasn't interested in trying to win a World Series. #NYM,1554591463186522112,mofunky77,51243568
Any #Mets fans happy with todays moves are delusional. They added NOTHING to help this team in October. A .216 hitter and a 32 year old reliever who is right handed and mostly terrible during his career. Eppler screwed the pooch today big time. #LGM,1554590182682365954,mofunky77,51243568
@JordanKatz11 Eppler gets an F for today. Bought in below average players while others loaded up. Ridiculous,1554589196437921792,mofunky77,51243568
#Mets deadline a complete and utter failure. No other way to say it. Epic failure by Eppler. #LGM,1554588716324331521,mofunky77,51243568
@WardyNYM No. Not really. Been terrible during most of his career.,1554588154958585857,mofunky77,51243568
@NYPost_Mets 32 years old. Mostly terrible during his career. Y did they trade for him ???,1554587882635116545,mofunky77,51243568
@AnthonyDiComo Good? We should all relax because if this trade? Clueless,1554587377980608514,mofunky77,51243568
@Chickendirt @macrobubble Was great with Toronto???? Is that y they ran him out of there? Maybe u need to smoke to get a clue.,1554586224110829573,mofunky77,51243568
@Ken_Rosenthal @TheAthletic #LGM close on nobody. Stay tuned.,1554585639554846720,mofunky77,51243568
@JonHeyman Bag of baseballs to the #Mets for 2 prospects,1554584517561704449,mofunky77,51243568
@macrobubble He was terrible on Toronto and terrible with #Isles. Those players are the ones Snow bought in.,1554577577171451904,mofunky77,51243568
@UKMetsNYC15 Haven't improved the team at all the last 2 weeks. 43 minutes left to do something impactful.,1554577124966780929,mofunky77,51243568
@Mets No bullpen help. No catcher improvements. Idiotic trade for a .216 hitter. JD PLUS 3 prospects for a 36 year old platoon player at best.,1554575761012658178,mofunky77,51243568
The #Isles ownership should have fired Lou Lamoriello when he went to fire Barry Trotz. At that point they should have let him go. Has been a TERRIBLE GM since leaving Devils.,1554574186349199362,mofunky77,51243568
#Mets have not improved bullpen. Especially a lefty. Havent upgraded the worst hitting catching position in baseball. As other teams in the National League have improved. Terrible moves. One hour left. #LGM,1554573379302219779,mofunky77,51243568
#Yankees add 5 pitchers and Benintendi. #Mets add a .216 hitter. Eppler being clueless today. #LGM,1554572645554966529,mofunky77,51243568
"A 36 year old hitting .216 is NOT worth JD Davis PLUS 3 prospects. That is an idiotic trade. Eppler has been terrible so far. 
#LGM",1554571054286258178,mofunky77,51243568
"Billy Eppler has done absolutely nothing to help the #Mets today. Nothing. One hour left.  
#LGM",1554570139445694474,mofunky77,51243568
Lets see if Eppler can give away more prospects for part time players hitting near .200. This has been a terrible day for #Mets. #LGM,1554569707235188738,mofunky77,51243568

Today's trade was idiotic. Guy is hitting .216 with no pop.,1554569146746257408,mofunky77,51243568
@losinvictus JD and 3 prospects for a .216 hitter with no pop. Not needed no matter how much u dont like Davis,1554568832207003657,mofunky77,51243568
"The #Mets traded JD Davis and 3 prospects for a .216 hitter who will platoon at best. IDIOTIC
#LGM",1554567477031485440,mofunky77,51243568
@NYNJHarper He's hitting .216. Very little power. Eppler has dropped the ball today while other teams have loaded up,1554566932585660428,mofunky77,51243568
@AnthonyDiComo He's hitting .216 with no pop. Useless,1554559537314762753,mofunky77,51243568
@TimBritton Nothing like landing a .216 hitter!,1554559341784666114,mofunky77,51243568
@ArmchairChaos He's been terrible for #Isles,1554545358277156864,mofunky77,51243568
Do the #Mets know what time the trade deadline is??? #LGM https://t.co/BNak7khi3G,1554516050506665985,mofunky77,51243568
@UFT @NYCComptroller @NYCMayor Need that money for more swagger. That will solve everything. He is actually worse than @BilldeBlasio . I didnt think that was even possible. #UFT,1554497449674285062,mofunky77,51243568
@DDuggan21 He is not the answer. Just another year of him proving that point.,1554495530708910082,mofunky77,51243568
@natesaundersF1 Let him know there's no whinning in the #NFL!!!,1554473868747853827,mofunky77,51243568
@AnthonyDiComo Gotta add something at catcher. Not saying Contreras but someone who can at least hit .200. Thats a dead spot in the lineup. Automatic out,1554456505767821314,mofunky77,51243568
@eyesonislesFS @JBuonoNYI More blue and orange smoke than usaul but he's still not coming here. I would like him too but we've all been played before. #Isles,1554452313879748612,mofunky77,51243568
@NYIslanders @williamdufour16 Do you think in a year or two he could be top 6 #NHL forward?,1554234239834537986,mofunky77,51243568
I'll believe #Kadri is a @NYIslanders when I see him pull on the sweater at the news conference. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me one thousand times shame on me. #Isles,1554211244218888192,mofunky77,51243568

@SempreMilanCom They are going to miss out AGAIN on one of their top targets. #Milan still looking for bargains instead of acting like a big boy club. Going to be a quick @ChampionsLeague again this year. No improvements over last years squad.,1551928396950786052,mofunky77,51243568
