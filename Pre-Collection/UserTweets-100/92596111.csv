@Irisheyz77 This is amazing! Thank you so much! We're thinking of going first week or so of October since we both have time to use up for the year. Sun sets around 7pm but we MIGHT have a chance to see northern lights.,1551608550560092161,sarahwandered,92596111
@Irisheyz77 Ohh! Thanks for the tip! Do you think the timeline I posted looks reasonable?,1551601863728009216,sarahwandered,92596111
Question for #Iceland travelers...is the following itinerary reasonable? We only have 6 days to play with including flights. Assuming all days will be full days of driving due to stops &amp; sightseeing. I added non-stop estimations to give a very general framework. cc: @Irisheyz77 https://t.co/NRoJPvqlHD,1551594069016678400,sarahwandered,92596111
