Today’s guilty plea from @brittneygriner isn’t a surprise rather than a move to get our sister home. @WNBA you should be ashamed of yourselves for the continued low salaries that forces our players to play overseas in the first damn place!! #wnba #FreeBG #BrittneyGriner #MONEY https://t.co/xPrQdL1azH,1546541088311238656,MediaHustle17,1104543469253640192

"Said it a 1000 times before and will say it again👇🏽This is the best basketball player of all-time. Kobe Bryant at his apex. A true 99 overall. The skill level, showmanship, the athletic aggression, the precision and perfection of each rep all on display here. Alpha dog.

⁦@KyrieIrving⁩ The Nike Kyrie Infinity aka Kyrie 8’s are dope. It’s a damn shame ⁦@Nike⁩ failed to market and made availability limited for a long time! No “Signature” athlete should endure that.
