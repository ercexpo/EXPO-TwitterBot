@bakkochel @0fficialMDEsq Idk Lou hasn‚Äôt moved any prospects so far. The word is Bailey is out to make room. He is 32 and makes 5M. Wont be losing any young guys. I have a feeling it will be 6-7 years at 7M,1554450824268582912,Christoff_77,291403416

"@islanders_takes Idk about the bunting v Lee but yeah having Matthews next to you the center can‚Äôt cheat and the def backs up a bit. I think Barzy on the wall becomes predictable.

"@islanders_takes Well I think the biggest issue is just that. Marner has help. All the focus isn‚Äôt on him.

@islanders_takes Only does that on the PP or when he is trying to open space. His game is heavily suited for center. There is a diff bet doing a lap when you want vs being forced to chase pucks in the corner with Trouba coming up behind you.

@crksinmrperfec1 Get a clue? Lol ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è okay.

@Philzfacts Okay? So what‚Ä¶ no a single contract offer was leaked on him. Because none of substance went through. Lou is on the hot seat more than any other GM.

@Philzfacts Didn‚Äôt say he wouldn‚Äôt help. Said he isn‚Äôt worth what his agent is looking for. Do you consider Kadri an elite 1st liner? If not then that is your answer.

@kschmann @IslesFix If they can get him for 5.5-6 for 4 years I am all for it. But it will likely be no less than 6 years and no less than 7M.

@IslesFix @kschmann agree 100%. You can‚Äôt sign a guy to 7-8M just because you think we can‚Äôt put out the same team. Wait till the DL and see what opens up. We need an elite wing.

"Some don‚Äôt understand that Barzal needs to play C. Doesn‚Äôt matter how good you think he is there or not. His game would suffer on wing. Speed, vision and passing are his weapons‚Ä¶ all suited for the middle of the ice.

"@NYIFANCENTRAL Martin has lost a step too but all the other guys you listed were a big reason the isles stayed somewhat afloat. Beau, Bailey, Martin had very tough years. All those other guys is nitpicking man. See what JGP does with a full year healthy and palms after getting his confidence",1551904834886012928,Christoff_77,291403416
@NYIFANCENTRAL Parise put up 35 points at league minimum.. Pageau was on pace for 42 pts on the 3rd line after not having feeling in his hand post surgery for the 1st month or 2. What are you talking about? Only Bailey is dead weight. If we get 2nd half palms he is more than fine.,1551904286916886531,Christoff_77,291403416

"@theRealAaaaar The F are you talking about? Due to shortened seasons his numbers are lower. His season totals or projected totals for his career is 85, 62, 72, 67, 66 so far.

"@BroadwayHatsNYR Also when I say unlikely a top 10 dman, I am not saying there isn‚Äôt still a good chance of it. He absolutely could. Just don‚Äôt know if the offense will be there enough for that.

@BroadwayHatsNYR No Isles fans even said anything lol ? I‚Äôll be the first. I think the chances of him being top 10 in the league are close to 0%. Top 10 defenseman is even unlikely. I do believe he will be very good. Enough to be a top pair dman on just about any team though. Def very talented,1551680349578600455,Christoff_77,291403416
"@islesmeetup_clt @NYIslanders This Jersey is considered nostalgic now. I think most fans in the nhl like it now, more than isles fans do. So for those concerned with that a) you shouldn‚Äôt care what others think and b) it won‚Äôt be mocked this time. Design and style has changed. This type of style is in now",1551653986150895616,Christoff_77,291403416
@kear20 @eyesonislesFS @stefen_rosner @JBuonoNYI Yeah I like it. Isles have only ever had 2 diff logos. Most teams switch constantly. It‚Äôs nice to be able to switch it up for a few games. It is unique too. Most people only hate it because the team sucked at the time they used it. Idc about that. It‚Äôs a Jersey lol nothing else,1551637723735285760,Christoff_77,291403416
