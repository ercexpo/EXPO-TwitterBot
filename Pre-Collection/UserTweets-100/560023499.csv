"A very interesting interpretation of ""Rock"" music by the contestants in Final @Jeopardy today. I don't think Beyonce, Gwen Stefani, or Tina Turner were ever in rock bands, and I don't know that the first two are eligible as individuals yet for the @rockhall.",1551706157747691523,DVSMoney,560023499

"If you're going to try to get that out at third, you have to make a good throw. Willy really rushed that one. This Brewers' defense is so infuriatingly bad. That, combined with their often anemic offense, makes we wonder how the heck they're still in first almost 100 games in.",1550694793713434624,DVSMoney,560023499
"An unfortunate defensive inning here. They could've had a scoreless inning if Renfroe's first throw had been on target, a would-be dp ball from Cron was just out of reach of the shifted Wong, and another Renfroe throw was in time but up the line on the second run.",1550690992550219777,DVSMoney,560023499
"Caratini didn't even make an attempt to pick that throw off the hop. What was Gustave doing standing in fair territory between home and third instead of backing up Victor, which allowed Cron to get to 2nd?",1550690076493058048,DVSMoney,560023499

"What another disgustingly disappointing loss for the Brewers.
This starting staff has to be going insane with this offense and defense behind them.

"I can't fathom how Counsell let Hader give up all 6 of those runs. With how he's pitched the last two weeks and how this inning was going, he should have been out after the Mercedes HBP where he threw only fastballs, despite being ahead of a hitter susceptible to his slider.",1548189767304503299,DVSMoney,560023499
"Renfroe has to dive for the Estrada popup that is coming straight down with Tellez &amp; Wong right there if he misses it. The only negative possibility there would be if he missed it and knocked it away, which was outweighed by the higher potential positive of making that catch.",1548188134109696000,DVSMoney,560023499
"I've lost count of the number of inexcusable losses by this team not just this season, but the last few weeks. They might not be in first much longer. This is shaping up to be like 2014 where they should've run away with the division, and inexplicably miss the playoffs entirely.",1548186864560979971,DVSMoney,560023499
"They have to get Hader out of the closer role immediately. They cannot afford to have him continue to inexcusably throw these games away. In his last 6 appearances, that's now 11 ER in only 4 1/3 IP. Hopefully it's just something mental and he can clear his head over the break.",1548185276421246976,DVSMoney,560023499

"@BrewerNation I don't understand their use of Hiura this season. Him vs. RHP (194 wRC+) is the most valuable split on the team.

"I still can't figure out how this is currently a first place team. They do so much stupid stuff to hamstring themselves it's insane.

"@BrewerNation It should be about what gives the team the best total chance to win, regardless of if there is the potential for future save opportunities.

"@BrewerNation If Counsell is being truthful, that is slightly concerning. Hader and Box both threw more innings and pitches over the last two weeks, but pitched today.

Hoby did a decent job, but he was the wrong man for the free runner situation and it wasn't enough. 5-5 against this Cubs team so far is simply not good enough.",1532199686538510336,DVSMoney,560023499
"It would be nice if Yelich showed any interest in being a good outfield defender. He has no range, despite not actually being slow. He has a noodle for an arm, and decided for some reason that he didn't need to get a running start behind that fly ball with the game on the line.",1532198219060596736,DVSMoney,560023499
Great first touch by Pulisic controlling the ball over the top.,1532149612575870977,DVSMoney,560023499
What was Donaruma doing staying on his line there? He could've beaten Di Maria to that ball. Old man Chiellini was never going to be able to keep Di Maria from beating him into the box.,1532084134348312579,DVSMoney,560023499
Awesome firefighting by Boxberger tonight to get out of bases loaded no outs with a one run lead to save Ashby's great performance and getting him his first win of the season.,1531472203195236353,DVSMoney,560023499
"Brosseau doesn't score on Wong's double, then Urias and Yelich fail to get either of them in. Small follows with 4 walks and 2 hits to not make it out of the third. Certainly not what the Brewers needed in this stretch of games with their current pitching situation.",1531340450862333953,DVSMoney,560023499

Its extremely unfortunate that this amazing series was deprived of a game 6 by a horrendously head-scratching overturned call.,1530047374491516929,DVSMoney,560023499
"From the couple of angles shown, that is a really surprising overturn for a kick-in. I sure didn't see a distinct kicking motion, and he was also being pushed forward from behind be a defender.",1530039326268133380,DVSMoney,560023499
"Nice bounce back from Boxberger to go through Hosmer, Myers, and Voit in order on strikeouts.
They obviously needed the win and it was 2-1 game, but I wonder if their bullpen strategy today with Williams for a third straight day says that Hader is likely to join them tomorrow?",1529605861559218176,DVSMoney,560023499

What a defensive inning by the Brewers. Starts with 0-2 count becoming a walk. An 0-2 hanger to Cronenworth for a single. Peterson turns likely double play into no outs. Urias has play at plate with momentum in that direction and barely gets out at 2nd. Thankfully only one run.,1529582179839262722,DVSMoney,560023499
"@BrewerNation Are you concerned at all with Boxberger to this point? His stats so far are improvements over last except for H/9 is slightly up and K/9 is way down, but he didn't convert 3 of his last 4 H/S chances last year after starting 26 of 28, and has started 8 of 12 this year.",1528979439006142464,DVSMoney,560023499
"What a loss for the Brewers, again. Has to be at least the third or fourth of those already this season that they gave away. They were actually on the right side of one last week vs. Atlanta, but it seems like they're on the wrong side of so many more.",1528973674241458177,DVSMoney,560023499
