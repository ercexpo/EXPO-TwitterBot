@eddieb2 I'm not buying that. I think she's getting bad info. From what I've heard from podcasts from people in the industry and there will be multiple tiers.

@jamaal_foulks It’s more nuanced than that. Defense typically starts faster than an offense in camp. Especially if there is new terminology on offense. By all accounts the Broncos defense is kicking their offense’s butt now. I would bet on that offense being better than the D long term.,1554573558730342403,RossRead,161694696
