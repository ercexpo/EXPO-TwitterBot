@SGudvangen Wel yah exactly that’s how they lower what they would have to give up for Ohtani.,1554199852694679552,matt08buzz,73822358
I don’t think Angels fans realize how unrealistic the haul for Ohtani would’ve been and no way could any team actually be able to or willing to give that up for one player. Angels will have to attach Rendons contract to make a more realist haul for the other team,1554168495381786624,matt08buzz,73822358
@garrettWtoon February would be wayyyyy to late in the off-season for comfort imo. Because if he says no then there’s no true way to get the most value out of a trade because a lot of teams rosters and moves are set,1554167972318523392,matt08buzz,73822358
@zack_hamel9 I knew there was no chance because Ohtanis value is too high to trade by himself. The only way Ohtani gets traded is if the team takes on Rendons contract as well and still give up top prospects,1554167340614443010,matt08buzz,73822358
