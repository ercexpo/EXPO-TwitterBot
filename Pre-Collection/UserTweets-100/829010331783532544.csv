"As we are wrapping up our regular season stats, we found we missed YET ANOTHER SCHOOL RECORD by Logan Kebisek.  With his 54 assists on Saturday, he surpassed @MatthewKorman (772) for Career Assists.  Logan stands alone at the top of the record books as only a FRESHMAN! https://t.co/Ij2WmForHK",1510981642067787776,CUWMVB,829010331783532544
