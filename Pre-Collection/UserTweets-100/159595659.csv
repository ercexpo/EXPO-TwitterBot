"So when Manny Machado hit the market, they acquire him as a rental, at a very modest cost in prospects. Mookie Betts? Again acquired at a very modest prospect cost. Scherzer/Turner? They traded Ruiz/Josiah Gray. Both are good, but the Dodgers had other options at those spots.",1554177300710666240,MajorLeagueACE,159595659
"And they also develop international signees (Diego Cartaya/Keibert Ruiz/Miguel Vargas, etc.). 

Put it all together and the Dodgers have continually had the prospects to be involved in any deadline deal they want to consider.",1554177292296810496,MajorLeagueACE,159595659
"And since then they've picked Gavin Lux/Michael Busch/Bobby Miller, all of whom are quite valuable in trade talks. They've also developed Gavin Stone/Alex Verdugo/Ryan Pepiot/Dustin May/Tony Gonsolin with later round picks.",1554177281077043202,MajorLeagueACE,159595659
"The Dodgers haven't been perfect in drafting, but time after time, they have found stars in the back of the first round: Corey Seager (18th pick, 2012), Walker Buehler (24th pick, 2015), Will Smith (32nd pick, 2016).",1554177272298344448,MajorLeagueACE,159595659
