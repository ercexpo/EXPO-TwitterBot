@eletrcfeels I don’t wanna burn my family out but I grew up in a pretty bad cycle of abuse and I’ve never abused anyone in my life. It’s like the nature vs nurture argument for serial killers. A lot of people the majority don’t become what they were victim too but some do.,1554538700331110400,fakeaf_,36210202
@eletrcfeels And it’s not a personal dig on you specifically bc serial means constantly doing it and you mentioned one situation and that’s coo. I been there I get it. But don’t make it justified in any way whatsoever.,1554537533777661953,fakeaf_,36210202
@eletrcfeels Literally the entire internet thinks it’s cute what are you talking about. Abusers remain abusers regardless of growth or not bc all it takes is certain things to bring it out of em. It’s the psychology of the mind but yeah aight.,1554537245654130688,fakeaf_,36210202

It’s a common misconception that winter is the time for seasonal depression. Seasonal depression is higher during the end of spring and the Summer.
