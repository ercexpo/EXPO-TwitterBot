"Now these are some looks! BoA's comeback definitely looks high budget and the quality there. I appreciate that. I've missed her Japanese work, and I'm very happy to see her return to music. I still need @BoAkwon to come do a U.S. tour please! https://t.co/NHjP555Mxs",1528775990301888515,DareDB,247675214
