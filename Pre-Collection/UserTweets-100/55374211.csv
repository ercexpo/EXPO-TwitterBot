Raiders get a pick by Sheppard on play 9. Then stop on play 10. Wolverines didn‚Äôt cross midfield on that series and raiders forced two turnovers. Physically - @CCCRaidersFB far superior,1553157691098415105,WMSRradio,55374211
"Raiders force a fumble, Sheppard scoop and score gets the raiders on the board again",1553156688160739335,WMSRradio,55374211
Raiders are on the board. @colepippenger10 connects with @ian_welden9 on play 10 from the 10. Pipp created on that play. He‚Äôs been limited on doing that with the green jersey and quick whistles,1553155064151375872,WMSRradio,55374211
"Nice tough run up the middle for 17 for @HeatonKonor to open up the @CCCRaidersFB next offensive set, followed by a 20 yard run by @Tristin04846033",1553153626708840449,WMSRradio,55374211

"On play 9 of this series, @colepippenger10 finds @JahlinOsborne over the middle for 35 yards. Hope to see that a LOT this fall. Raiders can‚Äôt move it on play 10, no score this series",1553150024330219520,WMSRradio,55374211

Then @colepippenger10 promptly pulls the next read and rips off 10 yards up the gut. War pigs cleared a path. Followed by 8 from @HeatonKonor in the same spot. Raiders running a lot behind the left side Russell Ralph and @robbie_gilley,1553149081781944322,WMSRradio,55374211
A really nice roll out connection @colepippenger10 to @jaidenfoster4 ‚Äî best ball of the afternoon so far,1553148643464577024,WMSRradio,55374211
Raider secondary gets cooked on the next play. Gives up 50 yard touchdown pass. First score of the afternoon,1553147645060943872,WMSRradio,55374211
Raider defense has held wolverines to about 10 yards on 7 plays before qb finally busts loose from the backfield  for 25 yard gain.,1553147478601605121,WMSRradio,55374211
Raiders turn it over after 10 plays at the Wolverine 16. Some missed opportunity that‚Äôll get cleaned up,1553145806185799682,WMSRradio,55374211
Now @colepippenger10 connects with Travis Martin the the seam for a. Ice fourth down conversion. Raiders marching - to the Wolverine 21 receivers slipping and falling quite a bit on wet surface,1553145398910386176,WMSRradio,55374211
"As expected, @colepippenger10 taking first team reps at quarterback. Busts a nice run up the middle on the first play. Tough to do those with a green jersey on. Follows that by connecting with @JahlinOsborne who gets tough YAC yards.",1553144591670444033,WMSRradio,55374211
The @CCCRaidersFB will be on offense first,1553144274295947268,WMSRradio,55374211
Perfect 2 for 2 on PAT attempts for Elijah McCoy @CCCRaidersFB during special teams work,1553144177541652481,WMSRradio,55374211
Raiders get a blocked PAT with @jaidenfoster4 coming off the edge,1553143744752484355,WMSRradio,55374211
