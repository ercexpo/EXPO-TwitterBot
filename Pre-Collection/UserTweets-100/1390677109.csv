@real_green_man @TheFlushingZoo Can we drop this? I really have no idea why we are relitigating Shreve. We both agree they could us another arm or 2. We have a slight difference of opinion on how urgent that need is. Could we just leave it at that? #LFGM,1554570746638356481,thebard1313,1390677109
@real_green_man @TheFlushingZoo Which is why I posted games. WAR as I’m sure you know is a cumulative stat. Loup has been in about 200 more games and pitched about 150 more innings. Viewed in that context it’s a minuscule difference,1554569277822451714,thebard1313,1390677109
