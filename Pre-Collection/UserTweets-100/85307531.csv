"@Dreamsinsun84 @Leslie_B68 I feel (and fear) that‚Äôs the right answer. She‚Äôs been on the show since 2018, which is just around the time an actor or actress either decides or has decided for them whether their future is in daytime. If I were hedging me bets, I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs likely not long for this show.",1553521195319951360,BySteveHolley,85307531

"@Leslie_B68 I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the ‚Äúneed to be controlled‚Äù line yesterday, but you‚Äôre right.
