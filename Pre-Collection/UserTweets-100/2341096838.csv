"@tomhouse @BulldogsEast Real life Greg Maddux touched 94, true, but Twitter Greg Maddux never got above 88, never allowed a fly ball, and every pitch was a dot to the low outside corner that only crossed the strike zone at the seams.",1542976858970624000,ryan_troxel,2341096838

"Well so far this summer in 4 tournaments I’ve seen 9 kids cross the 100 pitch mark, one getting up to 135. Along with that I’ve seen posts of a few dozen more. This setup should already be happening at the summer/fall level https://t.co/yyYtVE5yBq",1542603512793767936,ryan_troxel,2341096838

Adversity builds ballplayers. The Boys battled for a gritty 5-4 win in 8 innings over Post 502 JRs to move to 16-1. Adler Holtz ‘25 @VVikingbaseball won it with the walkoff 1B in the 8th!!

At the HS Level almost all of you are 75-85mph with your FB. College guys are low 8’s to low/mid 9’s. I swear on everything holy that HS pitchers can win throwing 79 with command and one consistent secondary pitch you can use in any count. I promise you.,1541867925132480513,ryan_troxel,2341096838

"How I like youth and HS pitchers to pitch/train during summer baseball:

1) Low innings &amp; pitch counts. Training days are valuable. Don’t lose them to a sore arm.
2) High intent innings. Learn to trust the fastball.
3) Get stronger. (Duh)
4) Learn to sprint as fast as you can.",1541822114981879809,ryan_troxel,2341096838
