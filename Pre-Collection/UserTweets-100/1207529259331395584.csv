About what I expected. A good lil comedy to change the mood of Marvel a bit. I feel lik they could hav done more wit the R-rating a bit, but I still enjoyed it. It’s good but ain’t great. https://t.co/xBbBHh3cEv",1530454768593866754,therayszone,1207529259331395584
This teams giving off major “88-93 wins with a WC Round loss” energy rn. It feels lik somethings missing,1530353996963233793,therayszone,1207529259331395584
