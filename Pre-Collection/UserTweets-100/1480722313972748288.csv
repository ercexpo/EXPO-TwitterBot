when sienna mae tries to downplay SA’ing someone by bringing up that she was 16/17 like she wasn’t 17 a whole ass week ago,1485076492426096645,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288
"miss sienna, please do explain why you didn’t address picking the literal lock of a bathroom door while jack was showering in your essay about why you SA’d someone…",1485075525064433666,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288

@marcus_faze Babe there was proof that Sienna SA’d him from the jump. So idk why you’re acting like it was just a mere accusation it’s not that hard to comprehend u sound weird,1484325086660218882,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288
@marcus_faze Use your critical thinking skills luv x,1484323520557424648,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288
@marcus_faze Uh maybe because SA isn’t exactly a topic to ‘stay neutral’ on… It’s not an opinionated matter it’s morally wrong. It’s not something you should just sit back and observe when that just enables predatory behavior. Staying quiet isn’t taking an accusation seriously either ?,1484323356153303043,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288
@marcus_faze believe all victims UNTIL proven otherwise. didn’t think i had to spell it out for u,1484311049491091459,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288
@marcus_faze so you’d rather believe a rapist first than a liar? that seems a little toxic but go off 🤝,1484310748511670273,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288

it hurts my heart that just a week ago these were the type of comments being left under jack’s videos. this is the exact reason why so many people  don’t come forward with their SA https://t.co/pUPqsC2uEt,1484278316576169984,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288
"now let’s see who still supports sienna mae after today because it truly speaks volumes the lengths that people will go to defend a sexual predator. believe all victims, that includes men. male SA victims deserve so much better",1484274523704856579,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288

@Luciousss_24 @ramannoodlesidk jacks friends ≠ jack. believe the victim of the situation. obviously siennas friends will defend her… they’re literally rape apologists. and where are the receipts of jack’s friends denying the allegations against sienna cause i’ve seen none of that happening whatsoever?,1484211158424948740,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288
"@Luciousss_24 @ramannoodlesidk he could have been SA’d more than once, by more than one person. who knows. but what happened with sienna is not a rumor or a speculation being that it’s on video. you’re sending a tik tok to support your idea yet jack posted this too, clearly referring to a SHE as in sienna… https://t.co/2Uqyzvo56v",1484209929544208385,maddyspisstowel,1480722313972748288
