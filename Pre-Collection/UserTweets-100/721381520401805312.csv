@mparker1662 Asking a heavy to go down a weight class when he naturally fights 15 over the limit was stupid to begin with. If Jake does not do anything he could have fought at heavy. He just did not want the fight but wanted to stay relevant. It will be another year before he fights.,1553558896261754881,STILLhere_Fly20,721381520401805312

@mparker1662 Exactly the commission is not going to say it is safe for a heavy to drop below 200 in a week. If Jake wants to fight big dogs then anything 200+ is fair game. Don‚Äôt sign to fight a heavyweight if you want them to cut down to you. Put on mass or catch weight the fight.,1553548592505163776,STILLhere_Fly20,721381520401805312
100% asking a heavyweight to drop to no heavier than 200 is ridiculous. When he fights at 215 normally. Then wanting him to drop to 205. Come on Jake we see you. If you want to fight the big dogs. No 200+is all fair game. https://t.co/0WQeR9EK3q,1553548023455617025,STILLhere_Fly20,721381520401805312

@mparker1662 Bro come on. He was mad the Hasim only lost 1 pound since the July 7 weigh in. Hasim said we could fight at 215 and proposed a contract with that in it. And Jake said nope not doing it. He said the fact he only lost one pound was in bad faith. Do you even know how this game works,1553545295719329793,STILLhere_Fly20,721381520401805312
