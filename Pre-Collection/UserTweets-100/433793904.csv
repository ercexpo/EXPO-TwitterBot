"Marlins-Blue Jays Trade

#Marlins trade: RHP Anthony Bass, RHP Zach Pop &amp; PTBNL 

Blue Jays trade: INF prospect Jordan Groshans

Overall, I like this deal for Miami. They move two relievers for a Top 100 prospect. Groshans has limited power but has a plus hit tool. 

Grade: B+",1554527249856094210,Hector_Baseball,433793904

"@Danilo_Sant0s @Mptness4 It's an unfortunate truth but it's something that needs to be done. I'm not saying it's gonna happen, I'm just saying that it needs to be done",1554208775707451512,Hector_Baseball,433793904
@Danilo_Sant0s @Mptness4 Trading Pablo could fix that hole in CF. Plenty of quality shortstops in free agency next year. Sherman gotta be ready to spend,1554207940806148098,Hector_Baseball,433793904
@Mptness4 @Danilo_Sant0s Marlins have to do something because this is not a playoff team even with the expanded playoffs. Start focusing on next season. Prioritize your younger guys that should be here next season. Let Lewin Diaz prove he's a big leaguer and let JJ and LeBlanc get their ABs,1554207678418788352,Hector_Baseball,433793904
@Mptness4 @Danilo_Sant0s That's the tricky part. I know he started hitting some front toss but he's probably got some ways to go,1554206663946768385,Hector_Baseball,433793904
"@Mptness4 @Danilo_Sant0s IMO, I think the Marlins should move Pablo only to an MLB ready bat, Jesus Aguilar and some bullpen arms like Bass and Okert. Maybe move BA as well to help get a proven bat and make Wendle your third baseman",1554206185494126599,Hector_Baseball,433793904
@Mptness4 @Danilo_Sant0s That's definitely a possibility but Josh Bell could be a better option if they are looking to add a DH,1554205392086962178,Hector_Baseball,433793904
@Danilo_Sant0s I think Cooper isn't going anywhere with Mancini to Houston. It's honestly better for Miami to keep Cooper because he's one of your proven bats with some control,1554204030125182977,Hector_Baseball,433793904
