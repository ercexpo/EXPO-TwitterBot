Cornyn admits that the most obvious explanation was the correct one: the GOP was lying about having sincere objections to the burn pit bill. It was “payback” for something else. Non-sociopaths think it’s weird &amp; cruel to hurt sick &amp; dying veterans to piss off a 3d party. https://t.co/0Z6D9o9hmo,1553739213618683905,law_comedy,701948504478908416
@JohnCornyn You are a sociopath. Imagine a dying veteran going to the emergency room and the attending physician saying “you’ll have to wait a week for treatment—your suffering will probably piss off my enemies.” You’re doing the same thing.,1553736709443133441,law_comedy,701948504478908416
@joshtpm It seems legislating is just a brand building exercise for her. She’s edgy. Contrarian. You can’t put her in a box. The downside: nobody likes the brand.,1553432755995906048,law_comedy,701948504478908416

"@jonstewart One thing the newfound critics of this bill have a hard time doing is identifying a single “changed” textual provision that would explain why they changed their votes. Despite many, many invitations, they can’t answer the question “where’s the beef”. Maybe it’s b/c they’re liars?",1553404407152246784,law_comedy,701948504478908416

I think it’s a mistake. Tribal identities are too rigid and unforgiving. I’d rather a little more focus on deeds and a little less on words. Not zero focus on words. Just a little less. 5/5,1553396556816154634,law_comedy,701948504478908416
"I think words and deeds matter. In his deeds, my Dad was helpful to everybody. In his words, my Dad would say things that aren’t defensible. In this performative era, I think words have superseded deeds, and we police words more than deeds to signal tribal identity. 4/",1553395796082659329,law_comedy,701948504478908416
