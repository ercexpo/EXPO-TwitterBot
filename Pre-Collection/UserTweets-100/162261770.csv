@stop_n_look That’s fine and neither am I lol. Shi just not a Top6 WR on this roster and I stand firm on that. Not even a indictment on him. Just right now he’s a Practice Squad player to me,1554608967833223168,4MR_Monty,162261770
@stop_n_look I mean I don’t think so no.  I think Returns get their own “spot” if I’m not mistaken. But even still. Shi ajnt 7 if that’s the case.,1554608036781621251,4MR_Monty,162261770
"@stop_n_look Yes bro lol. That’s what I’m saying, to be a WR5-6 you usually have to offer something on ST that Shi just doesn’t. It’s not even me saying it. That’s a big reason Shi fell to the 5th. He has a limited skill set",1554607881693106177,4MR_Monty,162261770
@stop_n_look They brought in a guy who specializes in returning kicks man. Shi returned 21 kicks over 4 YEARS lol. Agajn bro this isn’t the take u think it is.,1554607540058701825,4MR_Monty,162261770
"@CLTMVP @PanthersCulture @PanthersDen4MR I mean that’s not keeping him off the field. If so, why keep him at all?",1554606480371945472,4MR_Monty,162261770
@stop_n_look That’s also irrelevant. Shi adds NOTHING to an already mid ST room lmao. WR5-6s as usually used for ST pieces right?? I mean I’m not even understanding your point bro,1554606226666921985,4MR_Monty,162261770
"@stop_n_look The younger, faster guy not getting any more reps than the guy that’s offers more on ST lol. Nah this ain’t the take u think it is. 

Like I said earlier bro, if he has all this upside , he wouldn’t be losing a job to an UDFA who ALSO offers more on ST than him in Saunders",1554605995875356674,4MR_Monty,162261770
@stop_n_look I mean being able to play ST is a start. Shi didn’t return kicks or play gunner jn college and is too small to play gunner now lol. He literally adds nothing on ST vs Z lol. That’s a huge factor in making a team especially if you fighting for WR5-6.,1554605130531700736,4MR_Monty,162261770
"@stop_n_look Shi not close to this “upside” yall telling me neither lol. So he still don’t deserve a spot more than Z. And I don’t even dislike Shi. 

Yall just overhyping him",1554604811164782597,4MR_Monty,162261770
@stop_n_look Shi Smith upside is a faster Philly Brown lol. Y’all can’t tell me how it’s not neither,1554604243662901248,4MR_Monty,162261770
@stop_n_look Your only argument is that Shi is younger than Zylstra. Dassit Lmao. Shi not a better WR than him. He don’t offer more on ST than him (which is what’s going to help him get a roster spot) and there are LITERALLY 2 UDFAs getting more reps than him lol. What are y’all talking about,1554603986883428352,4MR_Monty,162261770

"@PanthersCulture @PanthersDen4MR Bro u just explained why CJ better and then double down with “oh shi more talented tho” lol. If that were true, he’d be playing more with the 1s and 2s. 

Our fans just want him to be better than he is bro. We do this with all local talent",1554593356440813571,4MR_Monty,162261770
