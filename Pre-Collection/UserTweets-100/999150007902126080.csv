"Chris Hemsworth is phenomenal, and his portrayal of Thor continues to be a delight. He fully leans into the silly, comedic persona so well, sometimes a bit over the top, while still providing other emotions when asked. A joy to watch. In addition, the best shape we‚Äôve seen him in https://t.co/IpNbqQ4sYm",1545263918460743681,manavsid07,999150007902126080
"#ThorLoveAndThunder was an extremely fun movie, that includes many tones in a quickly paced movie. It has a few lows, but the highs are through the roof/heavily outweigh them. Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi‚Äôs transformation of Thor continues to be a wonderful sight. I loved it https://t.co/pSTepS6Lwu",1545262512173563905,manavsid07,999150007902126080
"The highs of beautiful visuals, family interactions, and great history have been overshadowed by the lows: terrible story (and lack of attention to such), disproportionate focus on the less important, (some) suspect acting, etc. The pacing is SHOT.",1544736483898142720,manavsid07,999150007902126080
"#MsMarvel ep5 integrates real history with (some) great acting and beautiful visuals. But it‚Äôs all over the place even more, and is very hard to stay engaged with. And once again, where is the story? Too much of this show has felt pointless, and the storyline is dreadful/rushed",1544734888523247616,manavsid07,999150007902126080

"#MinionsTheRiseOfGru is a basic, fun for the family and kids movie. It‚Äôs got some solid funny moments and is fairly entertaining. Absurd and whimsical, and some nice tie-ins and references. Relatively average",1544476281655332866,manavsid07,999150007902126080
