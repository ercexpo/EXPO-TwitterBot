@jenni_4uk I saw this yesterday and I swear to God I just kept erasing stuff because I couldn't put everything I wanted to say in tweets. This guy is now a total douche bag in alot of people's eyes.,1553431259577290761,Jonesy2407,1531338120129658880
@TheFieldOf68 There's really too much wrong to put in tweets,1553430662249648130,Jonesy2407,1531338120129658880
@TheFieldOf68 Kaminsky over Anthony Davis? I would have had Grayson Allan over Zion and I hate GA,1553430452068880391,Jonesy2407,1531338120129658880
@MLBTSCommunity @MLBTheShow @MLBGaming This roster update is CRAP,1553113264191684613,Jonesy2407,1531338120129658880
If you need anything for your @MLBTheShow go see @RedMambaYT. He has done multiple things for me and it's always finished in nearly no time and has the cheapest prices of anyone in his maeket. I definitely vouch for the guy. He's a beast.,1553090431239553025,Jonesy2407,1531338120129658880

This is the first time I have heard this but I did see some pics of Zion from a week's ago and he's getting that extension. The dude is a shredded up straight monster.  Looks like he may have been 10% body fat if that. He may literally jump over the backboard now. https://t.co/EzwTlzEYXS,1553069459732062208,Jonesy2407,1531338120129658880
