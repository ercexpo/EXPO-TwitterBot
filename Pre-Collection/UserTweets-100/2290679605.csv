Idk how good Montas is going to be in the playoffs. To me he‚Äôs a #3 if we get a healthy Sevy back. Would‚Äôve Loved loved Rondon as a real #2 in between Cole and Sevy. I think As got a great package back. It‚Äôs a solid deal for both. #Yankees #Athletics,1554217230954598400,RonnieTrapie,2290679605

High High feeling the Yankees end up with Benintendi and Castillo. Last 2-3 deadlines I didn‚Äôt expect the Yanks to do much. But I think they going big this year. #Yankees,1552056870684196865,RonnieTrapie,2290679605
I just gave y‚Äôall some realistic offers. Not some these delusional offers that Yankees fans are coming up with. If you want to get an impact player back you going to have to give something back. #Yankees https://t.co/3wytprRWp8,1551695040917000195,RonnieTrapie,2290679605
If Castillo gets traded to the Yankees it‚Äôs probably going to take Dominguez or Peraza/Waldichuk. Plus one more prospect maybe Wells or Sweeney. #Reds going to ask for a lot. #Yankees,1551693905300799490,RonnieTrapie,2290679605

It‚Äôs insane. Those three are still not enough. It‚Äôs going to take a monster package and also taking back a bad contract to pull of the trade. Which is why I say it‚Äôs highly unlikely to happen. https://t.co/dJUm6POEHY,1551311333659926528,RonnieTrapie,2290679605

I really don‚Äôt think Cashman will give up those type of prospects and then go on to give Soto a $500M contract. It‚Äôs not how him or the Yankees have been operating these past years.
