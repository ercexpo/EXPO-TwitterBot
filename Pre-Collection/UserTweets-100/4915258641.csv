"If you got Lee at +300 like I did, it wouldnâ€™t be a bad idea to hedge a little on Druw Jones at +265 and Jackson Holliday at +600 now.",1548323140798799873,JakeFetner,4915258641
"Lee now at -350 to be drafted 1st overall on DraftKings. Iâ€™ve seen mocks with Druw Jones, Jackson Holliday, and even TerMarr Johnson going first overall recently, but I wonder if Vegas knows something ðŸ‘€ https://t.co/EHljn406wY",1548322490719514626,JakeFetner,4915258641

"Justin Crawford U 13.5 (+190)
(I think Crawford can go higher and sign for under slot) 

Brooks Lee +300 to be drafted 1st overall

"MLB Draft Props I Like:

Zach Neto U 12.5 (-115) 
(7 to Chicago is a popular landing spot in mocks)

Cooper Hjerpe +100 to be drafted before Gabriel Hughes
(Love the value here)

Cade Horton -225 to be drafted before Blade Tidwell
(Hefty price but I feel pretty confident)",1546933761891254273,JakeFetner,4915258641
