"Huge coup for the Reds picking up Cam Collier. This is one of the most advanced 17 year old hitters we've ever seen, one who could legitimately be in the majors before he can drink. Good power, should stick at 3B, but the hit tool/extraordinary baseball IQ are what you're buying.",1548839487509233664,jrushathletics,976530985541160960

How is @Cam_Collier16 and Justin Crawford still on the board? Too many nerds making decisions,1548826215733157890,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
Good pick for the Mets. I like Parada. Thought he would go no later than 8.,1548825620318240768,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
This draft is going way too fast to keep up with 💨,1548825356483919873,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
Gabriel Hughes to the Rockies. This draft is very unpredictable. There are some stud bats still left. Somebody is about to get lucky,1548823924162666498,jrushathletics,976530985541160960

@JoeDoyleMiLB I like him as a prospect. But I think the Cubs would go for a high school bat,1548823057770446849,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
Sounds like OF Gavin Cross to Kansas City.,1548822780052922369,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
@puddleomudd @Cam_Collier16 I’ve seen Brooks Lee ranked as high as 5 on the prospect list,1548822404582998017,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
"Brooks Lee is the pick, what do I know. Good luck, good hit tool. I get the pick, but I like Parada at this spot",1548821834409381888,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
@puddleomudd @Cam_Collier16 Their farm system is ok. Above average but not top 5. If the rumors are true they will be trading Wilson Contreas soon. They won’t be winning anytime soon,1548821501415243777,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
Twins are on the clock. They need a catcher in their system bad. Parada should be the pick here,1548820857920815111,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
"Cade Horton is a power arm, which I guess the Cubs need, but they are not ready to win any time soon. They needed a high school bat. Home town favorite @Cam_Collier16 just made too much sense for the Cubs",1548820451706785793,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
Great pick by the Marlins. I don’t love the pick by the Cubs,1548820133128331271,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
"Jacob Berry to the Marlins
Case Horton to the Cubs",1548819939393523713,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
"Elijah Green to the Nationals. Super Toolsy, Physical player. A ton of pop on his bat. Some swing and miss. A lot to like though",1548817150198091780,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
Yes. Can you be a steal this high in the draft? I would have taken him 1 or 2 https://t.co/GFnfM3MHFi,1548814872233779202,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
"Temarr Johnson goes 4 to the Pirates. Plus hit tool, he has the highest floor of anyone on this draft IMO. Only question is does he play SS or 2B. He will hit",1548814482402598912,jrushathletics,976530985541160960

@coach_MJ2 Agreed. I’ll be posting thoughts real soon,1548811673544585216,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
Drue Jones goes number 2. Probably the most upside in this draft. Potential 5 Tool guy. At worst he’s a Gold Glove in CF. MVP type potential,1548811527028867072,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
But I’m shocked with this pick. I have a few prep bats with higher hit grades,1548809705329401858,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
"Wow. Jackson Holiday goes 1 in the #MLBDraft. Shocked! This has to be a $ decision. The good is he is going to stick at SS, MLB bloodlines, LHH with good bat to ball skills",1548809549171331072,jrushathletics,976530985541160960
