"Just imagine what Martin Brodeur‚Äôs statistical career numbers would have been if the NHL and NHLPA did not have a couple work stoppages, especially during his prime. Maybe add 60 more wins and 13 more shutouts to his career totals if there were no stoppages perhaps? #NJDevils",1554570869237862400,PrimetimeSamWoo,17261460

"The #NHL took out the red line after the year long lock out in 2005 in order to create more offense &amp; flow to the game. Neutral zone trap schemes were not as effective.

Martin Brodeur throughout his career was an efficient goaltender. He had a knack of limiting second and third chance shots on goal by making sure there were no opportunities for rebounds. His puck handling skills also caused the #NHL to institute a trapezoid rule. #NJDevils,1554471744177688579,PrimetimeSamWoo,17261460
