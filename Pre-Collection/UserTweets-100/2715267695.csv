And hell yeah the DJ should get paid as good as the rappers do because they help make the music hot and even create the music for the artists sometimes. It should be an equal &amp; fair playing field. But in most cases it is not.,1554310269819490307,wshawn527,2715267695

Both the artist and the DJ should be respected. Because how are you going to get your music played if you're disrespecting each other it's a lose-lose situation.,1554307395030884353,wshawn527,2715267695
"If a DJ doesn't like you or your music for no reason at all except to be a hater then that's messed up. That DJ is not doing their job which is to play the music.

Has to be a personal reason why  that DJ won't play an artist's music. That's the bottom line.",1554306813549371392,wshawn527,2715267695
