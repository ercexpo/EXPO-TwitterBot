@JohnnyU713 @xtremeyouth1 @angrybevo21 @ImminentNattys @realscientistic Johnny I already I would 1k down on more then 7 wins and we will look better.

@xtremeyouth1 @angrybevo21 @JohnnyU713 @ImminentNattys @realscientistic People forget what the Texskins said about Cosmi. They had to completely start him over to develop him as a Olinemen. We weren’t developing and we had a bad culture. 8-9 games is whatever to me as long as I see the future plan. I don’t need instant gratification,1554592909672030212,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
@xtremeyouth1 @angrybevo21 @JohnnyU713 @ImminentNattys @realscientistic I’m looking at how bad the culture was. I feel like the last 8 years or more there’s been this spoiled I play for TEXAS country club living. Meaning at least half the team wasn’t putting in work.

@ImminentNattys @xtremeyouth1 @JohnnyU713 @angrybevo21 @realscientistic I’d be happy with 60-80 with certain stats. We were in all stats last between 95-120 depending on what stat you’re looking at on defense. Overall better on each stat is what I want to see.

@BeansWorld88 Why Shelby? What you heard on that?,1554165473532674048,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
"All ⛽️!
Thank you @TexasFootball @CoachSark @CoachJeffBanks @MikeBimonte_ https://t.co/YJn1kV9yPB",1554165356033368076,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
@SECLonghorns Yeah this is why I see overall improvement. How much is the question,1554165187699146757,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
@Dewayne42005783 Yeah I’ve been on him so that’s why I didn’t mention some. I love how he plays and how hard he plays.,1554165021986488321,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
@Stick_Pusher We won’t be elite but I’m predicted in the 70-80th range. Which I think we were in the over 100 range last year. It will be improved especially pressures. May not get the sacks but I see improvement overall but not where we want to be this year,1554164762631626760,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
@OhJay1978 Yeah would love to see that and I’m expecting the leap with him from what should’ve been after his freshman year. Good pick,1554162820320841729,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
"We still have a lot of high level names on the board. 
Why is y’all trippin? Haha relax and let it play out. We will still finish top 5 imo unless we shit the bed this season. Which I don’t think so and we’re at least 3 games above what we were last year",1554162530750185474,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
@TransEvolutions @HeightsMonica @justnotatweeter @notcapnamerica @DoorDash_Help Which is also sad we have to say this in todays society as well. Idgaf what you claim to be or want to be. Most of us don’t but it’s thrown around like the majority make the decisions of the one percent. It’s the same as this bs comment you made. It’s called common sense.,1553985622225862656,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
@JohnHmprpmphr @LarkinWarren @TransEvolutions @notcapnamerica @DoorDash_Help This is weak and honestly people need their ass beat bc of how often people get away with scummy crap. It’s called life without calling for help and owning up to your own bs. People hide behind the law that wasn’t meant for them to abuse.,1553984624921018368,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
@bakumshakum @TransEvolutions @schultzywinkles @notcapnamerica @DoorDash_Help Clearly nothing bc he does it too. This is our society today of people doing low value things and should feel safe at all times no matter what. Yeah he’s the prime example of how soft we’ve become,1553983368680935427,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464

@Mattbena85 I haven’t seen it but I don’t follow a lot of people or sites,1553980381786947584,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
When texas start turning up next year don’t hop on the bandwagon keep that same energy 🤝🎱,1553955204021747713,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464

As much as it’s changed I would still rather watch football and it’s not even close. Now if all shows were like Pate’s that would be better but unfortunately they’re not and never will be. https://t.co/9xrJwTqUeS,1553943073553530880,DTraiN5795,730563689388990464
