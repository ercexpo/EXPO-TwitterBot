That’s a massive series win for the #Mets. Taking 2/3 against a red-hot #Braves team minus Marte and McNeil on the road is a statement.,1547302041743237121,MPhillips331,879711995183935488
"The Mets’ starting pitchers absolutely dominated Atlanta this series. Wow.

Atlanta should be worried. They weren’t even all that competitive at-bats.

Atlanta’s only offense came against a guy who may not even be on the postseason roster.

Mets dominated.",1547296016931643397,MPhillips331,879711995183935488

"Doing it this way, and starting Max in the second half opener Friday night, would also likely ensure both are pitching in that big five-game series with the #Braves at Citi Field in early August. 5/5",1546586862629928962,MPhillips331,879711995183935488
Off day Monday would allow them to reset the rotation and give deGrom an extra day ahead of his next start in either Miami or Washington. Also avoids the hoopla of having his first start come in the Subway Series. 4/5,1546586861275160576,MPhillips331,879711995183935488
Staying five days would put deGrom's debut in line for Sunday night against the Padres. Would allow the #Mets to piggyback him with a guy like Carrasco so both get work in and the pen doesn't get crushed. 3/5,1546586860029362178,MPhillips331,879711995183935488
"If deGrom comes out of Thursday feeling good, five days would put him on Tuesday. Upper levels are on ASB with the majors but he could either go the FCL route or the org could schedule a sim game to get him to 5 innings, 65 pitches or so. 2/5",1546586858615971848,MPhillips331,879711995183935488
