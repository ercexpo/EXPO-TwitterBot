@DatProfessional @PSLToFlushing 100% it‚Äôs due to the Mets trading for Baez last year. They don‚Äôt want that to happen again.,1554602720996245507,ranked27,2777559180

@PSLToFlushing It just feels like they should have been more aggressive. I still feel as the Mets are missing another big bat. They also have a problem at 3B because Escobar hasn‚Äôt been that great and both catchers still can‚Äôt provide offense.,1554597480070889473,ranked27,2777559180
@PSLToFlushing Okay so. Vogelbach &gt; smith. Ruf &gt; Davis. Naquin can relieve marte or canha and he replaces jankowski. It‚Äôs definitely an upgrade. They got one bullpen arm and that was it. The Mets upgraded but‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt enough in my opinion compared to other teams contending.,1554597073533734914,ranked27,2777559180
