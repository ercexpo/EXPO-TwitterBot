Aiyuk will have 1100+ yards and 8+ TD’s this year. #49ers #FTTB,1554572113356304384,ryanghensley,28523343
Let me see what Grant’s talking about. *turns on YouTube,1554569971153326080,ryanghensley,28523343
It’s very possible Mason takes Hasty’s spot at the 3rd and long back,1554551279778598912,ryanghensley,28523343
Aiyuk was never the problem. FYI,1554541822541672448,ryanghensley,28523343
"@kevinstevens16 The center QB exchange is important. The sooner the better. I agree, the 49ers are stacked. I’d like to see them address the biggest issue they have right now and sign JC Tretter. Got to move Jimmy first.",1554490671653744640,ryanghensley,28523343
"49ers are worried about releasing Jimmy now so he can’t prepare for the season with his new team. I’m worried that if we don’t, we can’t grab a center and prepare for ours.",1554483947991552000,ryanghensley,28523343
Enough already. Cut Jimmy and sign a center.,1554319035533209601,ryanghensley,28523343
"I said on March 30th that Jimmy would be cut and not traded. I still think I’m right, but I’m willing to be wrong, and will take the L, as long as it happens soon. But the longer this goes on, the more likely it is he will just be released.",1554318352847228929,ryanghensley,28523343

"@jacob_sf_65 @KDH68760 @Tianakirkpatr10 @NinerNick_22 I didn’t deny that. You can’t sign a center until you cut Jimmy either so what are you talking about? Don’t be so sensitive about the 49ers bud, you’re not on the payroll and you don’t cut the checks. Cut Jimmy and add talent at every position you can. Now have a good night man",1553960803270737927,ryanghensley,28523343

"@jacob_sf_65 @KDH68760 @Tianakirkpatr10 @NinerNick_22 You cut or trade Jimmy, you can sign a center and a WR easy, and have more left over. I’m trying to understand your argument about why it’s better not to strengthen the team. We aren’t stacked there. Deebo or Aiyuk go down there is a major drop off. That’s how I view it. Sorry",1553957253786390530,ryanghensley,28523343

"@bdad2021 @obj Just because Kyle and Lynch drafted or signed them doesn’t mean they are capable of it either. I like Jennings as a slot possession receiver. I don’t seem as a 1 or 2. I hope they are all amazing, but I have no reason to believe that yet. Who cares what we pay? Debartolo didn’t.",1553915700980633600,ryanghensley,28523343
"Sports fans: You can like your team, even love your team, and still criticize them, still point out areas they can improve, and still not think every coach, unit, player, contract, GM, and owner is perfect. It’s okay.",1553913183819091968,ryanghensley,28523343
"@KDH68760 @Tianakirkpatr10 @NinerNick_22 I’m sorry I don’t understand your point. I don’t think the guys we have currently, beyond Deebo and Aiyuk will be effective as a 1 or 2 right now. There are a handful of free agents who have done it in the past who are still available that could make the unit stronger",1553912140716642304,ryanghensley,28523343
"@Tianakirkpatr10 @NinerNick_22 I don’t look at any of them as a number one or two receiver, yet at least.",1553907811809013760,ryanghensley,28523343
Notice Deebo’s contract expires at the same time Trey Lance will need a new huge one. #49ers,1553907552605204480,ryanghensley,28523343
@NinerNick_22 And grab a receiver. I’m not confident that we have a back up plan for Aiyuk or Deebo yet,1553905751386599424,ryanghensley,28523343
Deebo is extended. Now let’s get rid of Jimmy and we can find new story lines to beat to death. #49ers,1553899606831796224,ryanghensley,28523343
