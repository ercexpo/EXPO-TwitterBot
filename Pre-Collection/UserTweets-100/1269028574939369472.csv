it's always best at the beginning,1554501104578072576,maudelyrics,1269028574939369472
how i pulled away and you made me pay,1554493950504759296,maudelyrics,1269028574939369472
i guess i'll never understand the line between our love and romance,1554485961337102339,maudelyrics,1269028574939369472
so i made a list of all the reasons why i felt conflicted,1554478701722869766,maudelyrics,1269028574939369472
and we're just so damn lovesick,1554470966679707649,maudelyrics,1269028574939369472
"but, baby, you know that i just misbehave",1554463540710637569,maudelyrics,1269028574939369472

i don't deserve you as much as i want to,1554418034227286016,maudelyrics,1269028574939369472
that time when you called and i didn't answer,1554410483519655936,maudelyrics,1269028574939369472
