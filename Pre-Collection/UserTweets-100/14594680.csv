@CrateandBarrel @CrateandKids I want 1.) either confirmation my order will be here before the end of July as promised or 2.) a full refund immediately. Never shopping with you again. DM‚Äôing order # now.,1548487278887981058,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandBarrel @CrateandKids I now see that you‚Äôve charged my credit card AGAIN this evening! FOR WHAT?! You‚Äôve neither confirmed the delivery nor delivered any actual furniture to this point! I‚Äôve paid you $2,663.17 which is more than a 50% deposit and you have done nothing!",1548486787181359104,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandBarrel You‚Äôve now put us in a position where we will either have to pay out the nose to find a solution and likely won‚Äôt be able to find one because the earliest we can get furniture from anywhere is after her due date.,1548483820856287234,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandBarrel This has been a nightmare of a customer service experience and while I get supply chain issues, the complete lack of communication from C&amp;B is unacceptable. Had I known you would push back the original delivery timeline, I would have cancelled my order MONTHS ago.",1548483085984882688,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandBarrel Since responses to the @CrateandKids Twitter handle are sporadic at best, please see my latest string of tweets directed at them. Furniture ordered in March is now delayed indefinitely, which means our baby arriving in September will have an empty nursery.",1548482697986654209,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandBarrel since the @CrateandKids Twitter feed has been abandoned since 2020, please see my latest Twitter posts about the nightmare customer experience I would like your help with.",1548478461034913799,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandKids I‚Äôm hoping you can help us by either getting this furniture delivered by the late July date as originally promised or can help us cancel the order and get our $2,600+ refunded. Super disappointed in this entire experience with your brand.",1548477882208440320,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandKids And I get it - the supply chain issues suck. But why weren‚Äôt we warned that if we didn‚Äôt take the bed weeks ago we would be put in delivery purgatory? Why don‚Äôt you have automated alerts warning customers that their orders are delayed indefinitely?,1548477529169702914,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandKids I asked him NOT to do this as we are likely going to cancel the entire order and ask for a refund because the new timeline (if you can even call it a timeline since the date keeps getting pushed out) simply doesn‚Äôt work for is. He didn‚Äôt listen.,1548477116185841666,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandKids The rep I spoke to tonight has apparently pushed the order through - but all this means is that we are getting only PART of the bed (which makes it useless) and the dresser no earlier than late September.,1548476789235671040,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandKids And why has there been ZERO communication about the fact that an order is being pushed back indefinitely? I‚Äôm 7 weeks away from having a baby and we have nothing to use for her b/c we can‚Äôt spare our other kid‚Äôs furniture.,1548476301388173312,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandKids Why did this happen? Why didn‚Äôt the original rep advise me to take the bed at that time because otherwise you would ship it to another customer this delaying my ENTIRE ORDER for an indeterminate amount of time?,1548475900060045313,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandKids The issue is that now part of the bed - which was apparently available and ready several weeks ago per my convo with the other rep is now back ordered.,1548475661370916866,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandKids The customer service rep this evening told me I wouldn‚Äôt be getting ANYTHING from my order until October. OCTOBER. Close to EIGHT months after I placed the order.,1548475500296712193,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandKids It‚Äôs been radio silence since then, so I thought I‚Äôd check on the status of my order. And boy I‚Äôm glad I did.",1548475227532697604,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandKids the customer service rep said that PART of my order was ready: the bed. I asked her if the dresser was still on schedule for late July and she said yes, so I said it was fine to wait until the company could do one big delivery.",1548474996904710146,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandKids A month or so ago, I reached out to your customer service department b/c I received an email saying my order was ready for delivery, but when I clicked on the link to set up a delivery time, I was given an error message.",1548474623850729472,maryanncaram,14594680
@CrateandKids My order confirmation stated that the bed would arrive in mid May and the dresser in late July. Fine. Still plenty of time before Baby #2 arrives.,1548474262352064512,maryanncaram,14594680
"@CrateandKids I placed an order on 3/20 for a dresser and bed for my son‚Äôs room. Our 2nd child is due in early Sept, so it‚Äôs important we get this furniture as we are repurposing his stuff for the baby.",1548473920981852160,maryanncaram,14594680
