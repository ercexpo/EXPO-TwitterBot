"@desconfiad I'd play him as a sun or a player I'd think about subbing if he starts, I don't trust him for 90 whole minutes. But I agree, he needs a more solid position. Once Delgado is back he'll go up more.",1548506032799764480,rpena03,49922447
"@desconfiad The dude was done years ago. I honestly thought we had gotten him on TAM, and I'd have been cool with that. But as a DP, he's cancer for this team. He has no heart for the club. No passion. Obvious plays for money but that's not enough in this league. He's gotta want it.",1548505743782866945,rpena03,49922447
"I saw my friend on the TV for the #LAGalaxy match, and I felt so bad for her. They looked so sad. It was her first away game and she's a season tix holder. This team is one of the most disappointing teams we've ever had.",1548505353775509506,rpena03,49922447
"@desconfiad I'd Add Ravelson, Any CB, (Williams played well tonight, POTM for Galaxy, which is sad) I wish Judd had come in for Alvarez",1548504603129368586,rpena03,49922447
@desconfiad I'm cool with Efra leaving at this point. It's almost like players have success once they leave Galaxy. The French connection doesn't work. Jovelic was shut down today. It's real sad seeing Costa out there. Dude should just retire for everyone's sake.,1548504189197660162,rpena03,49922447
@soccerdiva @HammerEV Real bad. He has to snap out of it in order for us to have half a chance.,1548502665713266694,rpena03,49922447
"Except Efra not a DP. But some of y'all act as if we have to compare him to guys making A million+ $$$

Not that difficult to understand. Expectations should be equal across the board and hold your DP and TAM players to higher standards. https://t.co/E8uOJMhGAe",1548502348523139072,rpena03,49922447
"@desconfiad Yea cus it's a 2 player match for y'all.., it's 11v11 out there... but y'all go on and ignore the rest of the shit show",1548499244784332800,rpena03,49922447
