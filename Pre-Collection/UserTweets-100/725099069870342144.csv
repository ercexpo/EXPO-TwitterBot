"Like, when you say '95% of people in the U.S. got it from sex' you're basically just outright lying, and with percentages that high you aren't trying to communicate that sexually-active members of the LGBTQ+ community need it, you're implying that's its *sole* demographic",1552032168968392707,R3v0lvr0shawott,725099069870342144
