Trying to rationalize to 2008 me why the Padres are trading for the best young player in the last 50 years,1554498069089206277,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376

What in the world are the Red Sox doing? Shipping Vazquez away then getting Pham,1554244804963442688,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376

"The NFL has a really bad history with suspensions. Watson getting 6 games IS better than what other player have gotten in the past, but it’s still way to little. He committed sexual assault and his suspension should reflect that",1554108890765205506,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376

"The Shaws in Wiscasset is a lawless place.

Also if I haven’t said it before Jarren Duran is an absolute beast at baseball. No one is as much of a Durany as I am,1542945553155325952,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376

I really miss Will Bednar. I want another pitcher like Bednar. I lie awake at night thinking about pitchers like Bednar. I dream of a pitching performance like the one Bednar had last year,1541412536708485120,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Last thing I want to point out was the park this year. Omaha, like the rest of the parks, was super hitter friendly this year. Omaha has always been pitcher friendly, but this year offense was key. I hope to see some change for next year, for nothing else to see some close games",1541379659178319873,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Ole Miss might regress next year, but that should be expected. A lot of their team could have left last year but decided to stay, and now that they accomplished winning the title, they will leave for the majors. Very similar to what happened to Mississippi State last year",1541379142440067074,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Tennessee is going to be interesting next year. They were the top team right up until Notre Dame unseated them in the supers. A lot of the talent on that team is draft eligible, so the Vols might take some time to get back to this point",1541378850202030080,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"I’m also done with Texas. They had every opportunity this year. Consensus number 1 to start the season, a hosting bid despite losing their conference, the most talented team in the country, and the Golden Spikes winner. And they still were 2 and a q’d",1541378547163561986,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Stanford disappointed. They should have at least contended in their bracket, but they couldn’t win a game in Omaha. Disappointing for the top team left",1541378195261476865,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"It took all series, but game two was actually close. Late inning drama and no blowouts ensured that we had at least one good game in Omaha",1541378012297498624,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Oklahoma really proved their own. They should have earned a hosting bid, but traveling they still made a trip to the finals. With the move to the SEC imminent for the Sooners, they have proven they can hold their own in the conference",1541376199544430592,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Also, the last two national champions have come from Mississippi, and the last three have been from the SEC",1541375894379429888,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Ole Miss winning was a shock. Going from last team in to champions is difficult, especially to win the programs only title so far. Talented team with high end talent that stuck around one more year to win a title because of leadership from captain Tim Elko",1541375732592541697,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"So the College World Series is over. Couldn’t tweet the finals because of work, but now I can talk a bit about the fallout",1541375376785657861,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376

3-0 Ole Miss and we got Ump Cam back!,1538308240697589761,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Auburn’s Left Fielder is getting beaten up in the field. First he runs into the foul wall then the outfield wall,1538307656984797189,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"And Ole Miss exits the top of the first with a 2-0 lead. If the trend continues, how much will Ole Miss win by",1538301173127598083,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
We’ve barely started in Omaha and Ole Miss already leads 2-0,1538300116293103618,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Game over, Arkansas 17 Stanford 2. Not much to talk about. Connor Noland was amazing, Arkansas' defense was incredible, and Stanford looked outclassed. Let's hope Ole Miss and Auburn later today will be a closer game",1538275958049984512,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
You know it's a real blowout when the broadcast turns to talk of armadillos,1538273185870790659,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
One-sided blowouts by the lower-seeded team has been the formula so far. How many runs will Ole Miss put up on Auburn later tonight?,1538270488090316802,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Connor Noland is done. 7.2 innings of 1 run ball against the 2nd seeded team in the country. Another performance like that and his draft stock is going to skyrocket,1538267167589912588,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Connor Noland’s giving me serious Will Bednar flashbacks,1538262755840561161,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Arkansas chases another Stanford pitcher with a 7-1 lead. They look really sure in their ability to belong in Omaha,1538258595829239811,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
So Arkansas looks really comfortable all of a sudden,1538250424435855366,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
And then I can’t go to the dog park for 10 minutes without pitchers duel ending and Arkansas taking a massive lead,1538243428722659335,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
What a turn of events from yesterday,1538243242235465728,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
And of course after the massive first inning we have a pitchers duel,1538235142904246272,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Brock Jones continues his Omaha streak from last year and ties it for Stanford,1538228466029666305,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"For the inning Stanford had, allowing just one run ain’t all that bad",1538226408799064065,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Three balls put in play, all three deep fly-balls. Omaha is playing to the bats this year",1538223626897473539,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
And of course a lead-off triple starts the game,1538223116140290048,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Stanford easily has the best redemption story in this bracket. Coming one strike away last year from facing NC State only to blow it twice to Vandy,1538222868768641025,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"I'm back for today. No work, I can cover the College World Series all-day
Game 1: Arkansas and Stanford",1538220837463113730,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
AND THEN TEXAS BALKS IN A RUN,1537963577503469569,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Remember what I said about Texas, well Notre Dame is proving me right. Irish now up 4:1 in the 5th with Texas going to the bullpen",1537962511751782400,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Update: once again, defensive play is reversed on replay. 3:1 Notre Dame",1537956001495670784,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Defense key so far! Two incredible plays, one which may have just saved a run (review pending)",1537955140056932353,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Never mind,1537945448652021762,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Miller with the INCREDIBLE defensive play for Notre Dame,1537944921537073152,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"For a park that should play to the pitcher, Omaha sure has played to the hitter the last two years",1537938704391499776,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Texas feels like a team that should both be the top seed and doesn’t fell right to be at Omaha. I’m very conflicted,1537936087284207616,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
Everyone in the sports world is tweeting about the NBA finals. Not I. It’s College World Series time,1537922773770588160,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376

"The best regional to watch won’t be one of the top ones, but the Hattiesburg one. Having 4 teams that could make a surprise run to Omaha in Southern Miss, LSU, Kennesaw State and Army should lead to chaos, with this being the regional best suited for a cinderella story to emerge",1531695135406317570,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Of all the teams I think will underperform, Texas just doesn’t excite me this season. Miami has a tough regional and might just not make Super Regionals. Florida has shown the ability to beat top opponents but probably won’t make supers. Maryland rounds this group out",1531695134349352960,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"On the other side, the omission of NC State is surprising. NC State finished w/ a similar record to Ole Miss, w/the exact same conference record. Whereas Ole Miss finished strong, NC State started strong but slowly fell off, falling from a top 15 ranking to out of the top 25",1531695133023997953,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Of the last 4 in, Ole Miss has probably been the most talked about. Despite a below .500 conference record, Ole Miss finished the season strong, losing just 4 games over the month of May. The other last 4 in are Florida State, Grand Canyon and Liberty",1531695131962888193,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376

"Another team that arguably should have gotten a regional bid was Notre Dame. Notre Dame didn’t make the ACC championship game, but a hot start and a record of 35-14 should have earned them a regional bid",1531695129819500545,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Oklahoma surprisingly didn’t get a regional bid, despite beating Texas 8-1 to win the Big 12. Instead, the Sooners have to travel to Gainesville for their regional facing an overlooked Liberty team",1531695128657682432,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Texas went from the consensus number 1 seed to outside the top 8, but they get to hold onto a regional bid, hosting teams including Dallas Baptist, who came just 9 outs from a trip to Omaha last season",1531695127537778688,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Texas State should not be overlooked. The Bobcats had an incredibly strong season, going from unranked to a top 15 program. They won 45 games, split 2 games with then top-ranked Texas and won 2 of 3 against then 11th Arizona",1531695126225076224,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Vanderbilt struggled this season, as it seems that they have now lost their steam in the SEC, at least for this season. With a regional including Oregon State, they probably won’t make Super Regionals for the first time since 2016",1531695125155524608,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
"Tennessee as the top team is no surprise. They were the top team for the final month-plus of the season, and are seemingly an easy shoo-in to make the trip to Omaha for the second year in a row",1531695123830120448,TobiahZboray,789195432652005376
