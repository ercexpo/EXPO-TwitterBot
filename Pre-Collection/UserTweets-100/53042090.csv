@KingPuh69 @AwozF @ReviewngTheBrew That‚Äôs dude is 2 years away still. Ruiz could take Taylor‚Äôs job tomorrow,1554598798541742080,RyanKing702,53042090
"@johnnyc1952 It‚Äôs not every year or even decade that you have a Burnes, Woody, Peralta, hell even Lauer Rotation to play off of. You don‚Äôt have room in the OF for all of Yelich, Ruiz, Mitchell, Weimer, Frelick, Chourio. Thats crazy to me he couldn‚Äôt trade some of those guys for a MLB Bat",1554598647811059712,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 I know you are a big Stearns guy but this deadline has just left a really bad taste in my mouth. It just doesn‚Äôt feel like he wants to win a World Series with the window we have,1554597885139775488,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 Why would you want someone working here if they either don‚Äôt want to be here or isn‚Äôt trying to win a WS?,1554597622815473665,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 If he wants to leave I‚Äôm sure they would accommodate him,1554597184707866624,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 You telling me he can‚Äôt just resign ?,1554596712693477376,RyanKing702,53042090
@BallySportWI They don‚Äôt want to win the World Series. This is a god awful deadline for a ‚Äú1st place‚Äù team. Stearns lost the clubhouse with the Hader deal,1554596559756505089,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 Realistically this team is prob going to get the piss beaten out of them 1st round. Morale will be low. Stearns will resign in the offseason. The lack of aggression is just mind numbing,1554595979386531840,RyanKing702,53042090
@Qbaseball1969 No they aren‚Äôt. They showed their hand to the fans that they don‚Äôt give a fuck about winning a World Series,1554595108682551297,RyanKing702,53042090

@BadgersRiley David Stearns flat out punter this year away. The league can blame him for the Soto trade too,1554593840840855552,RyanKing702,53042090
@AdamMcCalvy Stearns broke the locker room,1554593636498583552,RyanKing702,53042090

@gr617_josh @Pac1Progressive @johnnyc1952 Corey Ray will never play for the Brewers full time at his rate. That‚Äôs a bust,1554461845272301569,RyanKing702,53042090
@HaakonMusic @johnnyc1952 That‚Äôs flawed logic though. How many guys don‚Äôt run because the ball is hit to him? He is exactly what you want in RF. I don‚Äôt even think of his Padre days cause of how young he was. He‚Äôs really come into his own with Boston and Milwaukee,1554456634922917888,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 @HaakonMusic But you can‚Äôt guarantee the internal replacements can match what he does either,1554454238075318272,RyanKing702,53042090
@HaakonMusic @johnnyc1952 Me having a conversation isn‚Äôt going well? Does their always have to be winners and losers in every convo?,1554454012933468160,RyanKing702,53042090
@HaakonMusic @johnnyc1952 Only hits Homers? Dude has a top 5 arm in baseball in the outfield. He is what our 2nd or 3rd best average on the team? Ops is strong as well.,1554453801905442817,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 @HaakonMusic So let a proven commodity walk? Don‚Äôt even try to resign him?,1554453408496594944,RyanKing702,53042090
@HaakonMusic @johnnyc1952 Renfroe is only 30. That dude has at least 6 good years of ball left,1554452912297820160,RyanKing702,53042090
@HaakonMusic @johnnyc1952 Yeah a 26 million dollar unmovable contract is in his way. That dude prob won‚Äôt even be a Brewer by end of today,1554449631920001026,RyanKing702,53042090
@Prudentissimus2 @HaakonMusic @johnnyc1952 If Turang is our CF next week that‚Äôs even more reason to hate the Hader trade. Why bother with Ruiz,1554449495185756160,RyanKing702,53042090
@HaakonMusic @johnnyc1952 Not in Milwaukee,1554448155969593344,RyanKing702,53042090
"@G_Webs_Since_93 @baseball7310 For every Frelick you have Corey Ray, Keston Hiura, and Lutz.",1554439913466056705,RyanKing702,53042090
@G_Webs_Since_93 @baseball7310 That‚Äôs cool. Our System isn‚Äôt even a top 20 farm system. That‚Äôs not saying much being a top 10 in our system. Frelick looks good. I don‚Äôt think Mitchell will ever play in MKE. Small has looked bad and Turang is looking better but I‚Äôm doubting he is playing MKE.,1554439721069072385,RyanKing702,53042090
@brewers_GM Oh no I‚Äôm well aware. You are just in denial. Small markets have to hit in the draft and develop prospects and talent because they can‚Äôt compete with the Big Payrolls. Antoine Kelly was a 2nd rd pick traded for a jail bird 36 year old reliever,1554434123904606210,RyanKing702,53042090
@brewers_GM I like J. C  But he ain‚Äôt the #3 prospect in baseball. Traded away the best closer since Mariano yet got next to nothing in return for the guy. Cy Young on Staff that we won‚Äôt be able to extend and will lose to FA or have to trade early in which I doubt Stearns gets value for him,1554428231503073280,RyanKing702,53042090

@PointsBetUSA Says who?,1554310677044477952,RyanKing702,53042090
@BadgerPharm37 Payroll has nothing to do with Draft. It has to do with FA‚Äôs sure. Not the draft,1554309729417015296,RyanKing702,53042090
I‚Äôm not denying that Matt Bush can help the Brewers this year. They needed pen arms desperately. My alarm is another 2nd round pick wasted and or traded away again.,1554308784138334208,RyanKing702,53042090
@WisTattDude84 I‚Äôm really not. I just think the dude is grossly overrated and gets way too much praise,1554308283313242112,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 It‚Äôs a crapshoot but it‚Äôs also how you build up a farm system without trading Stars every year. The Dodgers have an endless farm system and they trade no stars and pick late every year,1554307876734128128,RyanKing702,53042090
@baseball7310 It doesn‚Äôt alarm you that the majority of our top picks have been busts or given up on?,1554307281294004226,RyanKing702,53042090
@johnnyc1952 Mitchell won‚Äôt make it to Milwaukee. Hiura was given up on. Alex Binelas was traded quickly. Kelly was a 2nd round pick. Small isn‚Äôt looking too sharp. Corey Ray stinks. Zamora won‚Äôt make it. Lutz was a 1st in 2017 and isn‚Äôt out of AA yet. I‚Äôm alarmed with that,1554306567968735232,RyanKing702,53042090
