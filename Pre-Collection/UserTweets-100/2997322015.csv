I've never understood this mindset. Just bc you grew up near campus doesn't mean you want to attend there. Many kids also don't want to follow in their parent's footsteps. They want to venture out and make their own way. I don't see it as inexcusable. It happens often in CFB. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/zBdAGAFCFi,1554316273852588032,Hornsforlife,2997322015
@Paul44926402 Freddie didn't sign. Braves offered a more than fair contract. He chose to walk. Or possibly his agent (that he hired) chose for him. Freeman would be in Atlanta if he wanted to be. Riley clearly wanted to stay as he could have possibly made more by holding out. He didn't.,1554260782455705602,Hornsforlife,2997322015
