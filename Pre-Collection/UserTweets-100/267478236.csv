@JDynamitekid_J Darren McFadden was an amazing college RB. To say he was better than Reggie Bush is an interesting take though to say the least.,1553011199293489153,OSU_BarGuy,267478236
@httrhao I don’t know enough about the basketball team. I feel like Marv JR and Dawand could hold their own in a pickup game,1552798951459504133,OSU_BarGuy,267478236
@httrhao Is Holtman coaching?,1552798544062464001,OSU_BarGuy,267478236

@tjandg I think Hakeem won or Shaq backed out. I remember it,1552714724046938112,OSU_BarGuy,267478236
Wasn’t there supposed to be an Olajuwon vs Shaq 1 on 1 similar to this and one had to back out due to injury? Did I dream that? https://t.co/ouPPprEIYW,1552708959898828800,OSU_BarGuy,267478236

@BuckeyevsTworld @tjandg They’re convinced we would had won a national title if Jameson Williams didn’t transfer. Further more they act like Day kicked him off the team.,1552673883303690240,OSU_BarGuy,267478236
@tannerstyers_ @m1kecasper @BuckeyevsTworld But then a third of the fan base would say that JSN and CJ coming back has created a log jam and the incoming 5 star freshman will probably transfer because they didn’t move on.,1552468105997295616,OSU_BarGuy,267478236

"@ChaseDisPaper1 @m1kecasper He’s from Ohio, to Buckeye fans that doesn’t count. They should get them. But they also should get the top kids from the south from schools like Bama or UGA or else it’s a failure. At least apply the same logic.",1552438243450564609,OSU_BarGuy,267478236

@JDynamitekid_J @OSUCavsFan @AthletesInSpace I was wondering what happened to TrueBuckeye earlier today,1552431232671432706,OSU_BarGuy,267478236
@urbanmeyerlives The lack of awareness in the comments is gold though,1552421132984324097,OSU_BarGuy,267478236

"@GabeHoyer I think Knowles reputation is an unorthodox defense. When top recruits can see his plan for them work with other talented guys, it will open up. Like you said, top 20 defense and it will take off.",1552366064998256640,OSU_BarGuy,267478236
@ScarletpainEra2 @httrhao Maybe they are doing an elementary school show and tell type of deal,1552364041913438209,OSU_BarGuy,267478236
@GabeHoyer I think that is another aspect to this that people aren’t giving enough credit to. Knowles might have to sell his defense with Ohio State before top recruits are buying in.,1552363748572143616,OSU_BarGuy,267478236

@Buckeye_Legion That defense was a mess. Proof was on film that they didn’t have them ready and they didn’t know assignments.,1552306098354458624,OSU_BarGuy,267478236
Heard this stuff from Hafley and players in 2019. Hopefully we get same results. https://t.co/nUeag9tIxS,1552303595202174978,OSU_BarGuy,267478236

"@m1kecasper They look over that he completely got his first DC 100% right. He thought he was getting at least two years out of Hafley. I think Tarver striking out in 2018 on the recruiting trail and Hafley leaving left him in a bind for CB recruiting. Took a chance with Coombs, it backfired.",1551990341632512005,OSU_BarGuy,267478236

"@httrhao @tmb237 I don’t either. I don’t think Day has learned how to manage an entire team yet and is not psychotic like Urban was. He will get there, or he will hire a defensive coordinator that will act as the defensive head coach.
