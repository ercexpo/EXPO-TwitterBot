Questions that make the @Seahawks 2022 draft a B but could quickly become an A.  Can Cross show he is an above average run blocker and stay the best pass protector?  Who will backup ILB?  Will KWIII produce as a featured RB? This definitely is our best draft in 12 years!!,1520792575019413506,lcollinsrb
