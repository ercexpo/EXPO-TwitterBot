"Alyssa Naeher says it is clear there are no longer just a select few players in #NWSL who can score direct off set pieces. Ekic nearly beat her again tonight, Savannah DeMelo also proved her mettle serving/shooting balls in tonight

"The Chicago Red Stars have Won their regular season opener for the first time since 2015!

Ella Stevens and Bianca St-Georges with the goals!

Alyssa Naeher was brilliant.

It was a sloppy match with a lot of things to work on, but who cares (right now)?! They won! #MKOT",1520605842844041216,RedStarsReport
"Proud of @chicagoredstars for getting the win tonight!!! Also their first win against Racing Louisville. Alyssa Naeher is 100% the POTM. Impressive team win and can‚Äôt wait to see them back at full force with Yuki, Gautraut, and Pugh. #MKOT",1520605706504011776,cherylcomment1

"Biggest names I can think of for Connecticut are Kristine Lilly, Alyssa Naeher and Brianna Pinto (born here). We would need some help from college stars (Cyle Larin, Rachel Hill, Andre Blake, Matt Turner, etc.).

But as the Nutmeggers, we‚Äôd have the best team name for sure. https://t.co/JXPl3yvPG2",1520127938359926787,TimFromUConn
