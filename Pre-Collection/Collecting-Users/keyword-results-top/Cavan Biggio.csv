Cavan Biggio has been a huge disappointment thus far. Has a .045 avg. and now throwing error to cause a run instead of ending the inning #bluejays,1518318157949284355,natedogg734

That's enough Cavan Biggio. I've defended him long enough. I don't care how many positions you can play if you can't hit or play them competently. Figure it out in Buffalo #Bluejays #NextLevel,1518317479155703808,Chazx596
