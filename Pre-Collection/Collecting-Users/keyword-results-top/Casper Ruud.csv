"“We are in the age of the ultra-deep returner, thanks to Rafael Nadal.
Rafa started the revolution of standing wayyyy back near the back fence to return, and now other players such as Daniil Medvedev, Casper Ruud, and more are following suit.”- Finally someone to acknowledge it! https://t.co/6uRtXk9EX8",1519098244785184768,DqPoa

"🇩🇪🎾

1.5u Miomir Kecmanovic Q3 (+160)

Casper Ruud Q4 (-150)

Love both these, especially Kecmanovic. Mio has been playing some exceptional tennis and his hardest opponent will be Basilashvili or Ivashka in the QF. Also think Casper is worth backing at this price.. https://t.co/BpQWoPwR3o",1518383620184055809,vivekstats1
