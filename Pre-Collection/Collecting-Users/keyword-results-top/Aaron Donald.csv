Give me Aaron Donald over Russ Wilson all day. Dominant D linemen are harder to get than good QBs. https://t.co/yggqyDyNEd,1520913557688311810,jordan23atl
Definitely disagree. Bryce is miniature and doesn't run a lot. I don't think he's a can't miss prospect. I like CJ Stroud better but he has deficiencies too. I believe Will Anderson and Jalen Carter are can't miss prospects. I would rather have Aaron Donald than Russell Wilson. https://t.co/7aJtssDANM,1520913347633369088,jordan23atl
