@JeremyWGR Khalil Mack for sure. Was disappointed they moved up and passed on him.,1518941639359799303,Imsabbath84
@JeremyWGR @NateGearySports @WGR550 I WANTED KHALIL MACK!!! I don‚Äôt know that upset at the time is the right word though because Watkins was an exciting pick. Looking back. I‚Äôm upset!,1518941473743462406,Abrod219

Whichever tackle we pick up in the draft is going to have a field day at training camp. They‚Äôre gonna have to go up against Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack üò¨ But at least that will help them prepare for the best and be up to quality standards,1518616937017741312,rejbone
How Im viewing the Hutch v Walker debate. With Hutch you‚Äôre getting Trey Hendrickson. A steady force year in and out. With Walker you could get Khalil Mack or you could get Clowney. So that‚Äôs the risk. I don‚Äôt think Walker is necessarily a risk even if he‚Äôs Clowney but that‚Äôs me,1518608210760019969,J_Collyay
Everyone is abuzz with Elon Musk buying Twitter but I want to focus on just how BAD the Ryan Poles era seems to have started for the Bears. Their big DT signing failed his physical and the only WR they signed got arrested last night. AND they traded Khalil Mack.,1518572941671165952,purplebuckeye
"#Bears pass rusher Trevis Gipson stepped up in a big way after Khalil Mack went down with a season-ending injury in 2021. Now the unquestioned starter, what will 2022 hold for Gipson?
