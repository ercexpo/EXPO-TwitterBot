It's Lance Lynn for me. Showed up up in MN clearly disgruntled and it seemed like he took it out on the only team that offered him a job. Now not only is he a fantastic pitcher but he's known for being a monster competitor. https://t.co/d2HOGIBZWe,1520444453529477120,CodyPirkl

- TA7 struggling with poorly timed errors.
