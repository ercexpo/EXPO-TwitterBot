ok but what if the MCU had daemons like in His Dark Materials. can you imagine what everyone's daemons would be? and the TVA putting tiny collars on people's daemons :(,1518365531774107649,actuallycallie

It will never stop being entertaining to me that there was a moral panic over Harry Potter from some sectors of the Christian Right while His Dark Materials was over there like: THE CHURCH IS BAD. SIN IS GOOD. DEMONS ARE COOL ANIMAL COMPANIONS. SATAN WAS THE GOOD GUY.,1518285116925259777,wanderaesthetic
"I love His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman and their daemon concept. So... I was thinking that Albus' daemon would be a phoenix (pretty obvious) but I'm not sure about Grindelwad's daemon. What animal would be? A thestral? Silver fox?
