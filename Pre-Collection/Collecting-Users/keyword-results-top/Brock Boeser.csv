"I'm trying to figure out what Brock Boeser is to the Vancouver Canucks.

-He's a winger
-Scores 45-55 points a season
-Has a lethal shot

-He's not a 2-way player.
-Foot speed an issue
-Projected to score 30 goals a season but has not accomplished it yet to this date",1519016580008464384,CanucksHouse
Crazy to see that there are three 30 goal scorers on Canucks and not one of them is named Brock Boeser.,1519014361469100032,CanucksHouse
