The problem with drafting poorly over a span of 2 decades. You have to sign expensive FAs &amp; trade picks away for bonafide assets- which in turn puts more pressure on drafting well with fewer picks. Fewer picks restrict mobility on draft day. Rivals then get better thru draft.,1520183048293294080,JoeGaither6
