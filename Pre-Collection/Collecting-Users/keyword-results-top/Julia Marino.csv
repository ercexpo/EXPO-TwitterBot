We’re through 4 here as Donovan Catholic still leads. Check out this great play by Angelina Marino to end the inning on a laser hit by Julia Apostolakos. Griffins ahead 3-1 heading into the 5th. @DonovanGriffins @Donovansoftbal1 @brhsathletics @BRHSScotties @BrhsSoftball https://t.co/N0EzAcueeS,1518312728858931200,nj_athletics
