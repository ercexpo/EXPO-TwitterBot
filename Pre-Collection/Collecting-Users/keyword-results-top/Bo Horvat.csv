"@RyanHanaWWP Hey Ryan, I've heard that Vancouver intends to re-sign Brock Boeser and Bo Horvat and not do a rebuild. They will need to shed salary. I can see Yzerman taking on Tyler Myers contract for the 15th overall draft pick. What do you think?",1520715617728352258,AdrenRush39

Sat: I wouldn't be surprised if the org tackles the Horvat negotiations 1st. You're more likely to get a favourable # with Bo than JT. If u are able to get the # u want (with Bo) before you start negotiations with JT maybe u have more confidence about the # u want to hold firm to,1519502168260108288,taj1944
