FREE ADVICE: Casers Sportsbook has Miami's WIN over/under at 8.5 currently. That number may jump by a full point between now &amp; September. I suggest you all bet the OVER now before that number moves. If they sign a FA or make another trade for a player it may move quickly. https://t.co/olpy6R7pYi,1518403849345769475,DolphinsTalk
