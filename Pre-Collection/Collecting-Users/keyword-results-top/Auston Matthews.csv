"Watched the Lafleur video and all the goals he scored.  Don't want to slight Lafleur but if Auston Matthews played against those goalies, he'd have 400 goals. #LeafsForever",1518378733152866304,CamBoychuk
"No @espn, I can promise you Auston Matthews was not why @ovi8 had a 50 goal season. Auston did not ""motivate Ovi to elevate his game"". Good God, did Matthews pay you to praise him regardless of who you're supposed to be talking about? @Capitals #allcaps",1518378571290583040,sumner929

"Anyone watching to see if the ""awesome one"",  Auston Matthews, gets 60 goals for the season? Dude's been a scoring machine for the Toronto Maple Leafs! #NHL",1518372816525086721,KnightT2V
"More perspective on Auston Matthews's historic season:  

58 goals is tied for 42nd highest total of all-time (with eight others). 

Goal #59 would place him in a three-way tie with Dionne (78/89) and Bure (00/01) for 40th all-time. https://t.co/UwlfkaaaPu",1518372313498009600,Rob_DelMundo
