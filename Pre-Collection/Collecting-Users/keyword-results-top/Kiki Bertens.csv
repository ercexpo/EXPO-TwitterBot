"There will be no American women competing as qualifiers at the 2022 Mutua Madrid Open.

This occurred in 2010 (Aravane Rezai winner), 2014 (Maria Sharapova), 2017 (Simona Halep) and 2019 (Kiki Bertens)

Back then there were only 8 qualifiers.
Now, there are 12 qualifiers in Spain",1518952511121641472,_mdusk
