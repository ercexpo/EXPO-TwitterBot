Nothing like severely overreacting a month into the season #bluejays  https://t.co/Zq56yinqj5,1520025892122025986,RStovka
all im saying is ryu hyun jin got my family through some dark times when he was pitching for the dodgers,1519892549971759104,dkvkim
I will happily take this version if Stripling over the present version of Ryu. Good game from Rod tonight. Take your time coming back Hyun Jin. #NextLevel,1519478125255704578,DocNaismith
"The #BlueJays look to win the 4 game series tonight as Ross Stripling makes his 3rd start of the season in place of the injured Hyun Jin Ryu. 

This would also be the Jays first 3 game win streak of the season.
