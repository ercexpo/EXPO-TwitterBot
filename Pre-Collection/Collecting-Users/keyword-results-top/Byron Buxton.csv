I think it‚Äôs clear that Byron Buxton is one of the most impactful players in the league. Twins strand them loaded in the 8th with Buxton‚Äôs home run being the only reason this game is tied. Players not named Buxton are hitting around .205 with 10 total home runs this season.,1518341123785125888,GUnit_81
