Day 14: A Song by Springsteen

""Lost In The Flood"" - Bruce Springsteen

And somebody said, ""Hey man, did you see that?
His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud""
I wonder what the dude was sayin'
Or was he just lost in the flood?

Left its seeds while I was sleeping,

Still remains within the sound of silence.""
