"Sammy Watkins was a lot more exciting name when he played at Clemson. Still, the WR room needs depth and he provides that. I want to see two WRs taken with the first four draft picks and Watkins work his way into an effective role. This is textbook a low risk/high reward move.",1514699199278952452,Packers_Stuff,2180970049

"MVS will not be returning to Green Bay. It‚Äôs a bit of a bummer because it depletes our WR room even more, but MVS was never going to be a WR1.

Gutey has work to do. Don‚Äôt think for a second that Allen Lazard and Randall Cobb will be WR1 and WR2. Moves will be made.",1507088856092397569,Packers_Stuff,2180970049
"So far the Packers have essentially turned Davante Adams into Rasul Douglas, Robert Tonyan, and Jarran Reed. And they have two draft selections yet to be made.",1506383377879941130,Packers_Stuff,2180970049
"The Packers add some much needed help to the defensive line by signing DT Jarran Reed

Reed has not missed a game in two years and has tallied 1,658 defensive and ST snaps over that time

24.5 career sacks, 24 TFLs, 70 QB hits

"Za‚ÄôDarius Smith has agreed to terms with the Vikings

Agreeing to terms evidently doesn‚Äôt mean much to Z, but it sure would suck to see him in purple

The Packers still did the right thing letting him go",1506328785200812032,Packers_Stuff,2180970049
