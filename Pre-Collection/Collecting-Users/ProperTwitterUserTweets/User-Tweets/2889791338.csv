"In recent history, teams tend to shift the strength of their roster to the opposite side of the ball where their HC came from which is yeah..... https://t.co/pLxBMHDxyw",1514727201383624716,therealpattman,2889791338
"IMO we over analyze terms like talent, identify &amp; vision as we often try to quantify everything but for me, identify is merely finding what you do very well, make it the strength of the team &amp; regardless of the opp, something they had better have an answer to stop! #patttakes",1514467000910819332,therealpattman,2889791338

So we are going to use a top 10 pick on a guy and figuring out whose going to throw him the ball later when we have over $100M in 2023 cap space to just sign a guy next year makes little sense to me. https://t.co/bTOBVKUEsG,1514388847995539456,therealpattman,2889791338
