This ain't close folks. Come on. Dave Bautista one of better actors working today. The Rock is fun I get it but the Scorpion King or Tooth Fairy is far from Blade Runner 2049 &amp; Dune. https://t.co/4q7QM9dvA6,1513901531245989900,PatDaugherty51,1379754139

I hate the Democrat Party. Hate. They're everyone's drunk uncle that we all have to tolerate. But instead of dealing with them twice a year they run the federal govt.
