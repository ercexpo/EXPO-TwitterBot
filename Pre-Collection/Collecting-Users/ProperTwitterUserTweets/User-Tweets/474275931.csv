And some guy wants to repeat Lamelo and Haliburton are in the same tier. When Lamelo has accolades and records with the elite at his age https://t.co/8qteXMbMgx,1514695212668538886,TavitaLole,474275931

"3 things to watch for the Hornets offseason 
1. Miles contract 
2. Gordon Hayward 
3. JB &amp; Mitch.",1514557590881153025,TavitaLole,474275931
I feel most for Eric Collins and Dell Curry. They both are great announcers who deserve to cover playoff basketball,1514430432506527744,TavitaLole,474275931
I am Embarrassed.,1514423240973819908,TavitaLole,474275931
My blood pressure too high to be watching this game,1514397397547429888,TavitaLole,474275931

If Capela wants to drop 30 plus in win I will live but constantly leaving deadly 3pt shooter open is killing me,1514387286099693575,TavitaLole,474275931
"IT should be a priority to keep. We have too many people who NEED time. Don’t be so forced by what others are doing. The team has steadily improved and players have developed. 

Don’t believe me. They are literally connecting Hornets players to “BIGGER MARKETS”.",1514333125651972116,TavitaLole,474275931
"The Hornets should have no interest in Russell Westbrook for one reason. 

Isaiah Thomas. He had a 10 day with both teams and he BENEFITTED the Hornets. Yea we don’t like the Gordon Salary. When Gordon was signed he was one of the two best. He isn’t that no more. Just be patient",1514332843761152005,TavitaLole,474275931
