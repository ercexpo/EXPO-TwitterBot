Volk is a puzzle no one can figure out. #UFC273 #MMATwitter,1513027194074931200,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015
I really believe round 1 should have gone to Yan. He put way more pressure on Sterling and was the more active fighter. #UFC273,1513017969193979904,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015
"1 is up for grabs, 2 &amp; 3 are Sterling, 4 &amp; 5 are Yan. This could be a split decision. #UFC273",1513016022600720387,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015
Great round by Yan but I believe he has to finish him or he won't win. 2 &amp; 3 we're huge for Sterling. #UFC273,1513014723930898438,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015
Time for Yan to prove who the REAL champ is. #UFC273,1513005476602159106,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015
The hype is REAL and Burns is a fucking warrior. #UFC273,1513003149338071044,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015

This is wild #UFC273,1513001012738539521,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015
Dern taking this one. #UFC273,1512988781212807171,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015
"This was so nostalgic!! Man, I really miss watching Stone Cold Steve Austin. This shit brought me back to the late 90s early 2000s. #WrestleMania #StoneColdSteveAustin",1510469705370378244,Ricky__Spanish3,114559015
