I feel like the momentum shifted after that glue girl got on the floor. She’s the real mvp 😂😂,1514099254431666176,itscarrielou,1300871427441045504
They came back from being down 22 points. That fight though 💪🏽 #LetEmKnow,1514054045635268619,itscarrielou,1300871427441045504
I hate how nervous I get for these Cavs games https://t.co/q8KwftxNsU,1514016385139052544,itscarrielou,1300871427441045504

Did the Cavs not give out the junkyard dog chain yesterday? I totally would’ve given it to Rondo for those insane bowling assists lol. Can’t stop watching that highlight.,1513556369890488322,itscarrielou,1300871427441045504
"So since the Cavs are officially 8th seed, I can say that I wish they got rid of the play-in. Hopefully next year they’ll be in a spot where they don’t have to worry about it. #LetEmKnow",1513278463406354434,itscarrielou,1300871427441045504
