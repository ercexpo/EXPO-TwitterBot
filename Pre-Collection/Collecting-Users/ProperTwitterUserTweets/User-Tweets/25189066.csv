We really need to learn from our mistakes. Term limits with max ages. #TermLimits https://t.co/Fhdfn5i2iY,1514643590965780484,MichaelPStone,25189066
"Really interested to see what this commands. This is a very cool piece of history for any #Celtics or Larry Bird fan #Goldin @GoldinCo

Damn. Doc Rivers getting pissed at the reports for asking questions about playing Paul Reed. Going to try to not look into that too much. #SixersOutsiders #76ers,1513329820003979272,MichaelPStone,25189066
"You would think #Jokic and #Giannis would be cheering #Embiid on for the #NBAMVP to complete the 3 peat for international big men dominating the #NBA. Itâ€™s the right move, heâ€™s deserving and thereâ€™s zero need for people trying to justify him not being the MVP.",1512928786051969032,MichaelPStone,25189066
To think people donâ€™t call him the MVP ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #Embiid is going to get robbed  and it pisses me off. His revenge should be dominating everyone in the playoffs. https://t.co/tpn2ClzX6x,1512927215717163012,MichaelPStone,25189066
The #NBA needs to rescind their technical foul on Luka. Terrible no call and he had a right to be upset. The #NBARefs have been atrocious to say the least. https://t.co/1yDWGdxvGQ,1512683325219033089,MichaelPStone,25189066
Does anyone know how many come back to win games we have vs blown lead losses this year? #76ers #SixersOutsiders #Embiid,1512250254132981769,MichaelPStone,25189066
How much more value does Matisse provide in defending the perimeter with these long #Raptors ? #76ers #SixersOutsiders,1512247042906726403,MichaelPStone,25189066
"I am convinced Harden canâ€™t drive to the hoop effectively anymore. He needs to facilitate the ball, catch and shoot and thatâ€™s it. Weâ€™re better when heâ€™s not driving and complaining all the time. #SixersOutsiders",1512241410300391431,MichaelPStone,25189066
"The #76ers ? You mean the #Warriors with a team fully of Steph Currys ðŸ˜‚ 

Need to get on the defensive boards and get Embiid going. Heâ€™s the anchor when theyâ€™re up 20 and then they get ran on when heâ€™s sitting, so we need him doing his thing.",1512215745371176960,MichaelPStone,25189066
