King is in the Majors to stay. He shows great confidence in his game and has great stuff. Boone has used him in high leverage situations and in almost every game. Big add for Yanks!! https://t.co/JoxjBb7xaC,1514816644903682051,Bombersfan1,1083985663
"Tremendous pitching performances by Sevy and except for Chapman the Yankees pen. Great job by Mike King to lock it down.
Timely hits and 2 RBI by Trevino. And Farfel 3 for 3.
Nice split vs an excellent Jays team. On to Baltimore to feast on Birds.
Go Yanks !!",1514813886624505859,Bombersfan1,1083985663

"Why is Donaldson leading off? Don't we want a player that can beat out hits... bunts...steal a base...score from second...take the extra base. Donaldson is 37 with sore legs never steal if he gets on or score on that play he just got thrown out on. 
Where's Mickey Rivers ?",1514023993849925642,Bombersfan1,1083985663
