Currently listening to every song Tim was on to see which funky bass line I appreciated the most. Honestly? This dude was a talent. Incredible work. I‚Äôll update when I have a favorite picked out. For now they‚Äôre all my favorites. RIP Tim. #dancegavindance,1514751643438534664,NotConcerned18,25951910

"Hey @Spotify. How come every time I‚Äôm listening to a podcast, and I hit pause, and come back to it ten minutes later, it reminds by a half hour or more? No reason for that and when I‚Äôm listening to 3-hour podcasts it makes it harder to find my spot. Please correct this issue. Thx",1512925057248542727,NotConcerned18,25951910
