"#Rays are expected to have updates later today on Luis Patiño and JT Chargois, both of whom have oblique strains. Pending the severity of the strain, pitchers can miss anywhere from 2 weeks (think Jake Odorizzi who, if my memory serves correct missed 3 weeks) to 2 months.",1513928833971413000,XRaysSpex,177165531
