"75 years ago today on April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson took his historic place at first base at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, NY. Jackieâ€™s impact on the game of baseball and more importantly in desegregating our society is truly one for the ages. Thank you, Jackie! #JackieRobinsonDay https://t.co/fOezMCWppi",1514820932514185216,TimSternbergEdS,2912954043
