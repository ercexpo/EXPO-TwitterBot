"Twitter has all these problems but i don't think it needs a billionaire trying to buy it and make it worse than it is that includes letting people that should be banned back on her. You talking about chaos on here,Oh yeah is gonna be pure hell if that happens!",1514760906198208512,ToonamiFaith15,587633940
I believe this the reason why for that ending on #AEWDynamite last night. I know everyone including me didn't like that ending but at least it make sense why that ending happened. https://t.co/WQIDOfabms,1514740300513783810,ToonamiFaith15,587633940
"WB Discovery knows that they can bring DC on the Marvel &amp; Marvel Studios level and looking at what works and what doesn't work.

"I wonder if that overrun ending was a tester to see how the reaction was and given that TK learns from his mistakes on what to do and not to do,You know the fans reaction is all its gonna take to hear that. Call it a learning moment. #AEWDynamite #AEWonTBS",1514435705145024514,ToonamiFaith15,587633940
I don't know if that was an AEW angle or an ROH angle but was that ending really necessary given the extra 2 minutes. But that shouldn't overshadow on how great everything else was tonight! #AEWDynamite #AEWonTBS,1514427856452997122,ToonamiFaith15,587633940
