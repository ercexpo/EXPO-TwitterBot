"Well, the @sfchronicle earned my digital subscription dollars today with two powerful pieces of reporting and writing. First, a national political blockbuster by @TalKopan and @joegarofoli, two journalists going to bat for 40 million Californians (1/2) https://t.co/SjJu6HQpPt",1514804375872364554,ChrisCarrollDC,52494566
"Hey #Braves fans ‚Äî 3 more reasons to want @LieutenantDans7 off the team. Some tweets he liked:

1) a quote from the Mets shortstop 

2) anti-vax crap stemming from a suspended account

3) voter fraud claims that stirred up the Jan. 6 crowd

Pretty weak for a @VanderbiltU grad https://t.co/H0qLQKPOW4",1514791851663921154,ChrisCarrollDC,52494566
"Unless he learns to hit, welcomes Matt Olson as a team leader and abandons his bizarre attachment to Freeman, I look forward to the #Braves replacing @LieutenantDans7 with Trea Turner or Carlos Correa in 2023. A real two-way shortstop in Atlanta. Long overdue.",1514786386804584455,ChrisCarrollDC,52494566
"Last time the #Braves played in San Diego, @LadyTaylorNoel and I were wrapping up our #California honeymoon! Little did we know we were watching the World Series Champions a month before they won it all. Killer place to see a game or two. Let‚Äôs take four from the #Padres! https://t.co/1HWaMZwFIH",1514761508311474184,ChrisCarrollDC,52494566

"Annoyed the #Braves screwed up an incredibly winnable pair of series to start 2022. 3-4 against the dreadful #Reds and #Nats should be 6-1 or better. Thankfully, it‚Äôs a long season. Those of us with good memories know the World Champions didn‚Äôt wake up until August last year.",1514365966242746371,ChrisCarrollDC,52494566
"Says something about how *damn good* @ArcadeFire is that ‚ÄúGeneration A,‚Äù an unreleased song that lives on YouTube, may be one of their best ever. I wish we lived in a world where this was all over the radio. It‚Äôs perfect. https://t.co/gqUf2rSvwb",1514361197423964160,ChrisCarrollDC,52494566
No police officers and a malfunctioning camera in the subway station where this occurred. https://t.co/qPdSWSSNFH,1514213332106072064,ChrisCarrollDC,52494566
