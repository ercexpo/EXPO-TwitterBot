"Titans Mock 1.0
Losing two starting O-linemen in free agency gives them a direct need in the first round. Also, look for them to pounce on a QB if one slips. https://t.co/IkUdqYNCq1",1508828608848084994,ZoominZach2,1224454895702544384

"Bengals Mock 

Signing multiple olineman will help to make these picks flexible and could help Cinn be able to take a player like Lloyd if he slips that far. Look for a possible trade up if they can find someone who they think can start right away. https://t.co/dWItB9v1Ib",1506380177529614343,ZoominZach2,1224454895702544384

"Browns Mock
A lot of changes this offseason especially on the offense with Watson and Cooper coming over. No longer having a first-round pick will hurt but I just see the browns going best overall while filling gaps that they don't fill from free agency.I do see them getting a WR https://t.co/MXQcVuYlRf",1506030669503381514,ZoominZach2,1224454895702544384

"Broncos Mock 1.0

Baring free agency I see Denver going three ways at #9. QB, EDGE or DB (biggest needs being QB and EDGE), unless they trade up, it seems like a sit and wait spot, taking the best available from those 3 positions. https://t.co/VQ5KNmU5as",1501237115958480901,ZoominZach2,1224454895702544384
