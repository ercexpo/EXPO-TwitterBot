"Shut out the Blue Jays twice. Sevy and Nestor were disgusting, Taillon looked very solid. Bullpen was overall great. Back of the order showed some life. Vlad played the best game of his career against Cole for 1 of Jays wins. Not a bad series split. Yanks move to 4-3.",1514813737575714820,YanksYak,1029181680651853824

The worst ive ever seen Chapman. Wasnt even in the zip code of the strike zone the entire inning. Now King has to save us in a terrible position vs Springer Bichette Guerrero. Brutal spot.,1514810790271881219,YanksYak,1029181680651853824
Chapman is a complete head case,1514810219267715082,YanksYak,1029181680651853824
