I would gladly watch the Kings get swept in absolutely hilarious and horrendous fashion against anybody in the playoffs if it means that we make the playoffs.,1514466942114959362,kevinyoung90,100869011

LOL SUCK IT @Avalanche YOU DIDN’T SCORE TEN,1514457529689915401,kevinyoung90,100869011
Strive to be as cheerful as a Kings fan facing a six-goal deficit. https://t.co/sXZTzVQica,1514456957326815235,kevinyoung90,100869011
"The Kings averaged 3.67 goals per game on this road trip.

That is pretty damn good.",1514456747380932611,kevinyoung90,100869011
"I can’t believe the Kings kept them from getting a hat trick for so long.

Another moral victory.",1514453276095561728,kevinyoung90,100869011
"Tomorrow’s games with @MoneyPuckdotcom win probability:

NSH 48.9%, home to EDM.
DAL 43.1%, home to MIN.
VGK 37.7%, away at CGY.

There is a fair chance that tonight’s loss won’t even mean anything. Of course, the VGK-CGY game is the one that matters most.",1514445384340307972,kevinyoung90,100869011
Must be nice to be an Avalanche fan.,1514443505363419140,kevinyoung90,100869011
Do you guys ever think about where the Kings would be if they had kept Darcy Kuemper instead of trading him for Tobias Rieder? Because I do every time he owns us.,1514435695657435140,kevinyoung90,100869011
