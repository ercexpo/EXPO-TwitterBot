Very sad to hear of the passing of @archieeversole. I was supposed to meet him in the parking lot before the ATL-NYCFC playoff match with Jay Riddle but he wasn’t there. Met Poet and @Bayern_Ryan though! Such an amazing song - We Ready. https://t.co/0Cfpe1xQgV,1514387666812428288,delshaffer,17488046
