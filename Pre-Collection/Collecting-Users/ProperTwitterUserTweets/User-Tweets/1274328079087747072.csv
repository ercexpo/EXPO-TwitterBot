This is a very good mock for me.  I traded down with saints to get picks 16 &amp; 19 then trade back from 16 to 28 and accumulated a shit ton of picks!!  What do you think @cmikesspinmove https://t.co/V7qNEa08Bi,1513952030997442560,MRayble,1274328079087747072
This is how you honor a young man after finding out this tragic news.  good on you @RapSheet  rest easy Dwayne Haskins gone too soon.  He was so young.  Very sad. Prayers to his family during this difficult time. https://t.co/XDBqY2U449,1512827792202747908,MRayble,1274328079087747072
I like this kid.  Though in my opinion he looks dominant in games at times but there are other times where he is off in lala land and misses his assignment.  But that can be fixed.  If he gets the proper coaching and situation this kid can thrive in the NFL. https://t.co/SJPA91zwPn,1511765793159061506,MRayble,1274328079087747072
