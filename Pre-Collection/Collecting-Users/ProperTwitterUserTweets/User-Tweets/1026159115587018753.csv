"Only 5 games last year with under 6 targets. Will be an extreme value in drafts. 

Only 3 TD’s even with Hopkins out. The definition of “better in best ball” https://t.co/xaJyV9655L",1514688737317470219,DrakeFantasy,1026159115587018753
"Gun to your head, which sport can you name more active players:",1514670649389862925,DrakeFantasy,1026159115587018753
"Could the #Eagles trade up w/ #Panthers who don’t have 2nd or 3rd round picks so Philly can get ahead of #Giants for Sauce Gardner?

Carolina would like to stay ahead of #Saints while targeting a QB.

Eagles own picks 15 + 18",1514657631427862530,DrakeFantasy,1026159115587018753

I’m feeling some best ball drafts tonight. Who’s up for one? https://t.co/tUryMRZHoA",1514389855601577988,DrakeFantasy,1026159115587018753
Woah woah woah we drink on the @FFHustle too! https://t.co/mfXVTPt8iw,1514353992993759251,DrakeFantasy,1026159115587018753
My fears with USFL + XFL are you aren’t selling players. Can’t market the teams. It’s “hey come bet on glorified semi pro football.”  Fans are fickle w/ their time in spring + summer. https://t.co/SFzdaifOSK,1514275758599983105,DrakeFantasy,1026159115587018753
"This is what worries me about the USFL + XFL. If the NFL can’t find enough good QB’s, who is going to pay to watch the 90th best pro QB throw ducks? https://t.co/uwtYuyqdLZ",1514272657419681794,DrakeFantasy,1026159115587018753
"Jalen Hurts finished as QB 9 in 2021. 

He’s 23-years-old + likely to add an early round WR to DeVonta Smith + Dallas Goedert. 

Through wk 12 was QB 2 (injured ankle that game) was averaging 21.91 pts

His ADP in FFPC is QB 10. https://t.co/61hRIqjLvV",1514084325054103554,DrakeFantasy,1026159115587018753
