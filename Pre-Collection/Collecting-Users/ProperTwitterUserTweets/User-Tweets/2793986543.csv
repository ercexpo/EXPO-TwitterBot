Like i said we show him so much hate but he has been working with disfunction his whole career.  I think we can win with him.  He has the best team ever assembled for him now.  I expect great things. https://t.co/nD0NfRKJz3,1514547461225910283,4EVARDR,2793986543
I hired my baby brother to work with me.  And today he sold his first two cars ever!!!  He just started too.  So proud of the baby brother.  He moved all the way from Los Ángeles to start his life over.  He used to love with dad but it’s time for him to be his own man.  So proud. https://t.co/dCZ3p5ftuV,1514393311498448906,4EVARDR,2793986543
Ok so my question got answered.  She sent me a picture of a female mini Goldendoodle.  She said Jack will never be replaced but she needs to fill the void.  This dog was born Oct 2021 and is already trained.  I guess I might be getting a dog tomorrow https://t.co/QikGBtyNTK,1514366750128852999,4EVARDR,2793986543
So I was debating if I get another dog for my wife.  Jack was hers and my oldest daughters dog.  She has been crying non stop and I don’t know how to help her.  Should I get her another dog?,1514320004522651654,4EVARDR,2793986543
