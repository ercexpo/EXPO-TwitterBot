"An impressive volume of nob licking going on for McIlExcuses meaningless last round. He’s done this about 10x, backdooring a top 10 he can’t win. To wit: “ oh it’s been windy, a weird weather pattern, a weird schedule, ad hominem” @dennispaulson62 @ColtKnost @SiriusXMPGATOUR",1513636095145222157,TexasCardsFan1,420946496
"Yep. But when you’re 60, you’re mad about all the time you wasted loving ppl who just sucked the love &amp; life out of you, who misrepresented their love for you which was actually their love of what you could do for them. 

And then you realize you were just wasting time. https://t.co/RAufiwLmHx",1513547854014558210,TexasCardsFan1,420946496

"Thank you, AP. Moz really thanks you because now he’s a legend in his own mind, and doesn’t have to answer questions about SP, which will come. And he’ll say “We’re not ARBITRAGING our future, CLEARLY, for 1 year, when  I just want a WC spot.”  https://t.co/tM0IRVXGZv",1512642836788822019,TexasCardsFan1,420946496
"It’s a #disgrace that a team who dominated the grapefruit league does not automatically earn a postseason berth before the season starts. 

Also, Pity the poor Padres who gave up a couple of prospects for a top of the rotation LHSP under control for 2 years. Such #losers. #Blowzo https://t.co/GsU7OLHM5L",1511483775305367558,TexasCardsFan1,420946496
"It’s amazing how many Carp fans go bonkers tryn to defend him when the same guys go ape shit bat crazy over Yadi’s vast accomplishments and contributions. I really don’t get Fan Bois Matt Carpenter Club, as if you’re the righteous fans. STFU.",1510596912394637315,TexasCardsFan1,420946496
"Nobody here ever said he wasn’t. What I said was, his last 910 PA’s/763AB’s  make him collectively the worst player in MLB over past 3 years. Why does that make us bad guys?
