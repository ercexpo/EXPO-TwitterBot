Do you think that #joeygallo ever gets sick and tired of striking out every at bat?,1513685573667639300,iannello15,68508814
225 million is a crap ton of money for a 30 year old outfielder who is injury prone. The money was there; this is on Aaron Judge who will end up like Conforto,1512443199595298818,iannello15,68508814
"First pitch is 3 1/2 hours. This Aaron Judge contract isn't looking too good. If no agreement by first pitch, @Yankees should be calling up Texas and seeing if Jack Leiter is available via trade",1512421021587951618,iannello15,68508814
"Probably not a popular thing to say on twitter but if Judge isn't extended in the next 12 hours, I would wait until the all star break and see where the team stands. If the Jays and Rays are running away with the division, then its time to tear it down.",1512079613622513672,iannello15,68508814
#Yankees have traded Luke Voit for a Doritos Locos taco,1504855604321562624,iannello15,68508814
"Not gonna lie, Corey Seager played the market beautifully. 10 years, 325 million. Market for Correa is minimal. I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up getting a 6 or 7 year deal for 250-275",1504476131180748800,iannello15,68508814
"At this point, the #Yankees  MUST sign Correa. I was completely against it until the Jays just got Chapman. You have to keep pace, otherwise this year is a wash.",1504101800735035396,iannello15,68508814
This off-season was a major disappointment. Yankees failed to get any big name free agents again. And still have yet to legitimately address their rotation…again.,1504043445350023175,iannello15,68508814
Is Bryan Reynolds still available via trade or…,1503484241010733063,iannello15,68508814
Carlos Correa has been completely forgotten about. Might be best to get a 1 year deal and try free agency again next winter,1503483372605222918,iannello15,68508814
