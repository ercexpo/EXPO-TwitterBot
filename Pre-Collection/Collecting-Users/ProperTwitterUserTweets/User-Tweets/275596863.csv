"Remember, #Yotes fans eye on the prize. Finish last and they have by far the best chance at top 2 pick. 3rd pick at worst. Lots of very good players available. Also several of our really good young players will be returning from injury next season. All is not lost.",1514813385963040771,CoyotesAvs12,275596863
I don't know how (or why) my brother does it but he watches multiple games at the same time. He's watching the Avs and Rockies at the same time. I can't do that. I have to watch one primary game or else I know I will miss something important. ðŸ˜ƒ,1514797240933498895,CoyotesAvs12,275596863
The national champion DU Pioneers in attendance at the #Avs game. Very cool! @DU_Hockey #GoAvsGo,1514780944728657920,CoyotesAvs12,275596863
There is a silver lining to super high inflation. Series I savings bonds based on the latest #CPI (Consumer Price Index) are now paying 8.37% for a full year if bought before May 1st. Can't beat that guaranteed return. https://t.co/lxF9zIm6BQ,1514752497667125255,CoyotesAvs12,275596863
