"But I tried so hard
But we killed our hearts
In the valleys low
I hear the trumpets blow

Yeah, I tried so hard
Yet I'm lost and scarred
And I'm filled with regret
Yet I sing

And we laughed
Oh, and we cried
And thought

Oh, what a life",1514458404210851841,beefdaddy4,2980203298

"My hopes are so high
That your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me
So I die happy?

To fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry
Whichever you prefer",1514414174411046916,beefdaddy4,2980203298
