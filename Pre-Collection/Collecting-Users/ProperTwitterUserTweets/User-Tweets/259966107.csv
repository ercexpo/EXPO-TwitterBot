"No idea what led to the scrum, but food on Ryan Hartman. Fuck Evander Kane, he's a disgusting excuse of a human. https://t.co/BGj42tnm5S",1514375844671590403,BenchWarmerView,259966107
Hertl and Meier fighting? Guess Viel fighting didn't solve anything.,1514042213658886150,BenchWarmerView,259966107
"Players like Deebo are too critical to selling the product. Fans would revolt. If you can't keep everyone that's big money, then trade Armstead or Warner first. Deebo and Bosa are too important.",1514025025367523334,BenchWarmerView,259966107
Balls that are on the edge of the kzone line going either way is one thing. But balls that completely miss the zone by a full balls width should never be called strikes. And balls that are fully inside the kzone line should never be called balls. Give me robo umps! https://t.co/P00OkUHiQm,1513750317699006466,BenchWarmerView,259966107
This umpire has been so bad tonight. Calling balls way off the plate strikes and balls well within the kzone balls. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1513747422261891073,BenchWarmerView,259966107

This home plate ump blows. Called balls clearly off plate strikes and clearly in the zone balls.,1513731743269875714,BenchWarmerView,259966107
