"Selling two tickets to Game 2, Celtics vs Nets on Wednesday. Loge 6, Row E. DM for more https://t.co/2JsqStILkP",1514740599282413569,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
"4 months till he debuts 

4 years till he declines a 7 year, $30 million extension

6 years till he’s traded for three kids currently in 7th grade https://t.co/dE7JM7SbyY",1514429821639606278,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
"This is exactly right. If it's a no-hitter and he's at 105 pitches or something, I think 90% of fans would understand it. Pulling a pitcher with a perfect game who's thrown 80 goddamn pitches is an act of war on any casual fan becoming interested in a baseball game https://t.co/woGJAsn5cR",1514323241963302926,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
It should be illegal to take a pitcher who has a perfect game out unless a body part physically falls off. Put that in the next CBA,1514320304050524168,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
This series is going to be more important to me than a sporting event should be for a man in his 30s. Oh well let’s fucking gooooo,1514056931610136579,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
Feels like the Sox could very easily be either 5-0 or 0-5. So credit to them for keeping things spicy I suppose,1513970277872459778,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
"Dealing Renfroe and getting back a solid prospect haul? Sure I can get behind that

Being cheap little fucks and replacing Renfroe's production with a platoon of MLB's worst hitter in 2021 and a 2B trying to play RF for the first time ever? Uhhh, yea, pretty dumb",1513939516758839296,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
"I don’t believe baseball is dying, but if it does die I am blaming the bottom of the Red Sox lineup",1513648714237235205,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
"Some guys, like Pedroia, Lester (the 1st time), Xander (the 1st time) will take the money. Hell, look at the Braves. I expect them to be VERY aggressive with the Casas, Yorke, Mayer group early. But yea I’d consider jerseys more like 3-6 year investments https://t.co/jHi27RiCIH",1513559475646607360,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
"I would legitimately be shocked if the Red Sox ever retain a homegrown player at full market value. They’ll gladly offer 60-75% and hope the player inks the deal, but the Mookie strategy was never a one-off to dip below the CBT, it was what the organization truly believes https://t.co/9ETV8FNRQs",1513556460424343553,Mike_Dyer13,532494064
