Dubon is an arbitration player. He's literally playing for his next contract. If he has to put his helmet on backwards to get a hit then he should. Let the kids play https://t.co/2xOVDNnNST,1514253811711414278,TheTennisRat,299410733
Dee Strange-Gordon is a nightmare for whoever makes uniforms. Really long last name and that guy weighs a buck twenty so there's no room on the back of his jersey for all those letters. He should just do initials on the nameplate and save the stitcher the nightmares,1514089376107614208,TheTennisRat,299410733
"I love EY Sr and Jr. Both really great guys. 

I've never gained respect for a player as quickly as I did when Jr accidently stepped on Tim Hudsons ankle. Showed a lot of class in how he handled that moment. So glad he's still in the game https://t.co/TpXeDfmfdX",1514029121940168710,TheTennisRat,299410733

"Imagine caring this much about the name of your favorite baseball team. Even worse, imagine wanting them to change it back to the Super racist name and logo. 

Braves can become the cows for what I care. I'm a fan of the team. Not the name or logo https://t.co/PH9XtzZJRi",1513858318200102915,TheTennisRat,299410733
