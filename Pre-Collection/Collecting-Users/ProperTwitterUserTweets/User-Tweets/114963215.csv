"First Ctrl F player I searched for was FAU CB Zyon Gilbert - I had him JUST outside of draftable range. Sure enough, he's Mr. Irrelevant here. HWS likely pushes him into late Day 3. Super toolsy testing &amp; tape profile will enhance PS chances, maybe final 53 depending on scheme. https://t.co/u8N3FfVwky",1514701125974331416,MarkDulgerian,114963215
"Did this exercise last week. The names that end up PFAs are particularly interesting this year, as expected. https://t.co/3fGOVvR6J2",1514295632487350274,MarkDulgerian,114963215
"Tyler Linderbaum will run into some early challenges in pass game due to length disadvantages. But the 3 plays below showcase the type of range, recovery/balance, agility &amp; eyes elite undersized iOL possess in today’s spread out NFL. https://t.co/45vAUSAXTq",1513957626467713024,MarkDulgerian,114963215
Exactly on point. Top 5 LB (hybrid) in this class imo but very scheme specific. https://t.co/2Wxl8tK4yQ,1512471779326914565,MarkDulgerian,114963215
"With CFB being the monster it is, why haven’t networks capitalized on using this time of year for lookahead content??
Spring rosters/standouts (NFL prospects)
NIL stars
Preseason rankings
Schedule
Portal action (CFB free agency)

Grabs pure CFB fans &amp; already-tuned-in draft fans!",1511868775888408577,MarkDulgerian,114963215
"From a pre-release aesthetics standpoint, it doesn't get much uglier than Philip Rivers. But few prospects have been better with layering and velocity control to make every single throw. Love the downfield aggression to his future NFL WRs.

"Love Travon Walker's physical &amp; athletic traits combo. But expecting a guy w/ 9.5 career sacks to be my franchise DPR as a top 3 pick is too tough a sell for me. 
2021 ranks among 266 FBS players w/ 250+ pass rush snaps (PFF):
Sack %: 158th
Pressure %: 147th
Win %: 176th",1511422368257822722,MarkDulgerian,114963215
"In an age where large sample size analytics data is easily available, it seems silly media still spends 5 mins on like 2 plays to ""debunk"" a prospect's weaknesses. If a QB only makes the right read 2/5 times vs college defenses, what are we really learning?",1511083569384415239,MarkDulgerian,114963215
"Kyle Hamilton plays at 4.5. Only questions I have at this point are:
- Hips for slot M/M
- Eyes when he tackles
- What his 40 training looked like
- Notre Dame’s slow turf

**Some questions much more important than others**",1509170396817346563,MarkDulgerian,114963215
"Recipe's set for most unpredictable 1st Rd in recent memory:
- Fewest teams (24) since 2000 slated to pick = fewer draft boards/team fits = more ""reaches""?
- Record 7 teams w/ 2+ picks = more trades?
- Lack of blue chippers = higher variance in position rankings",1508940062465032194,MarkDulgerian,114963215
