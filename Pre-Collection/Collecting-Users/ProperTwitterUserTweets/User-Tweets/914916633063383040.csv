So I canâ€™t change the last leg of a flight from London/ Atlanta/ Miami to be Ft Lauderdale without changing the whole itinerary and losing my upgraded seat on the longest leg of the flight? Makes no sense @Delta,1513943852830318604,Knightsofgolf1,914916633063383040
Come on @Delta Iâ€™ve been on their website chat for over an hour because I canâ€™t change my flight onlineðŸ˜¡and itâ€™s also over an hour wait for a callback.,1513929203728662532,Knightsofgolf1,914916633063383040
