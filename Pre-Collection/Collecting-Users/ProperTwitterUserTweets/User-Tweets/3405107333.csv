"5'8 CB Marcus Jones (Houston) vs. 6'3 WR Alec Pierce (CINCY)

Jones is feisty, explosive, with good hips in transition.

Love how he is relentless through the catch point to prevent the TD on this play https://t.co/vrF2nSolaH",1514747403009916929,nickfalato,3405107333

"Auburn CB Roger McCreary is one of the best man coverage CBs in the draft

However, he will have the shortest arms for a CB (28 7/8"") 

His fluidity, skills at the LOS, feistiness through the catch point, and body control are impressive

McCreary fits in Wink's man-scheme https://t.co/v6qlzaiOCP",1514623008702353414,nickfalato,3405107333

Impressive hustle and closing burst to sack the QB by Channing Tindall here https://t.co/1MGqw7Jter,1513899491111235585,nickfalato,3405107333
"Georgia LB Channing Tindall fits the #Giants 

We speak a lot about Leo Chenal - rightfully so - and his fit in Wink's pressure system, but Tindall must be in that convo and is more fluid in space (at 230 lbs)

Weirdly enough, they both had 102 PR reps in 2021 w/ 26 pressures https://t.co/CijcGnucuu",1513898232916561920,nickfalato,3405107333
