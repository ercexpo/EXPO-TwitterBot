Winning being a factor in ROTY voting is insane lmao,1514988219548332035,darwinchvz320,888098930210127872
Don’t like valorizing athletes playing through injury cuz it always makes me uncomfortable seeing dudes limp or physically struggle on the court,1514986014942633987,darwinchvz320,888098930210127872
Kawhi has never been one to rush back from injury which is a stance I find admirable. Don’t play until you feel right https://t.co/TrfUCz8f7Y,1514985583591886848,darwinchvz320,888098930210127872
