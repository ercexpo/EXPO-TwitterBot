"With Team #Sonic Racing turning 3-years old next month, I'm thinking about doing a looking back on video for it. In addition to the Sonic Frontiers hype.

But since I'm waiting for TSR to download. What are your thoughts on the game, and do you have any tips for me when I start? https://t.co/I8WCLSwtjj",1514745250539098117,Blueknight_V2,828970622839554048
"Anyone ever get annoying with the fact, that almost every single #Sonic game since the PS3, 360 &amp; Wii era only allow you to have 1-save at a time?

I'm just sayin' that needs to change with #SonicFrontiers.

Games like Ratchet &amp; Clank PS4 did it, but went back with Rift Apart. https://t.co/Aap81DdJnX",1514646484595228675,Blueknight_V2,828970622839554048
"I've been out of the Crash On The Run loop for awhile, but does anyone know if the game can now be played entirely offline? Like how #Sonic Dash is?

"I just noticed that there's just a random cat in the #RatchetAndClankRiftApart vinyl art. Not sure if this was actually a thing in the game, or the Puffoid-shaped ships for that matter.

But yeah, interesting.ðŸ˜…

"Guess it's been long enough to avoid spoilers for #RatchetClankRiftApart, but I really like some of these concept designs for Emperor Nefarious &amp; Rivet.

One of them referencing Dr. Nefarious' concept from UYA. Honestly, the tentacle-leg one is SO cool! I wish it made the cut! https://t.co/upncZFzqd0",1514099393053483010,Blueknight_V2,828970622839554048
"This isn't the video for the main channel I was talking about, but here's a quick compilation video I've put together for the secondary channel.

Focusing on the various bugs &amp; glitches I've come across in #HorizonForbiddenWest since launch. Enjoy. :)

"Well, guess YouTube's down again.

Still able to watch videos, &amp; check notifications. But can't access the side bar, or switch accounts. :/ https://t.co/GyfXnfNC35",1513960779132903434,Blueknight_V2,828970622839554048
"I 100% second this!

Seeing as #Sonic games have a tendency to get demos during gaming shows, or simply be Japanese exclusive.

Why not release a demo for Frontiers? Not only would the fans appreciate it, but it'll allow for creative input. Just don't lock it behind pre-orders. https://t.co/4V4DU5ztup",1513906498325430272,Blueknight_V2,828970622839554048
