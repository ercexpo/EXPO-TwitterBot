Chimaev vs Covington is gonna be crazy.,1513006626428624901,BengalsChampion,1318775598551044097
Stories about players following/unfollowing teams and the possible hidden meaning are so annoying. Teams and players can be so petty,1512318316253229058,BengalsChampion,1318775598551044097
Remember when the #Bengals were so good at retaining their own guys that we had them for almost too long. I miss that tbh.,1511734334591537158,BengalsChampion,1318775598551044097
I had a dream that Larry O went back to Cleveland on a one year deal. Let‚Äôs hope this doesn‚Äôt happen. #Bengals,1509178981140119552,BengalsChampion,1318775598551044097
Damn I really liked @lil_t8te. I was hoping the Bengals would be able to keep him but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs looking for for more playing time in Atlanta.,1508555863602176000,BengalsChampion,1318775598551044097
