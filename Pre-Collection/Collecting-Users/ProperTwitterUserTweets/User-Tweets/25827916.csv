When me and @KnicksBig15 get that WOJ BOMB that the @nyknicks have traded Julius Randle and OBI will be our starting pf next season. https://t.co/FTKZsfWaCz,1513586779647090696,knicks81,25827916
New year same story. Players went to win and get the bag 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/TxvRRJJcGg,1513585821017939975,knicks81,25827916
Beautiful way to end the season and hopefully have momentum moving to the off-season. https://t.co/FhwPOG8XtX,1513555098529681420,knicks81,25827916
Obi Toppin to me can be as good as Amari Stoudemire with a three point shot. He has a very high ceiling that Julius Randle doesn’t have and he’s able to play without the ball,1513546445575667722,knicks81,25827916
I feel like the Knicks Front office isn’t sure if they should have Julius Randle be the main option on the Knicks or if they should have the RJ Barrett lead the team and if they don’t make a decision they’re gonna end up coming back with both of them it’s gonna be a disaster,1513508414747459584,knicks81,25827916
