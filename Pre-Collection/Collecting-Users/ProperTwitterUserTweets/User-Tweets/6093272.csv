"Adam by E ve (yes extra space) is my kind of jam. Suprise and not surprised to see SELEE's logo in a few sequences. Few scenes remind me of Love &amp; Pop. Liminal space &amp; surreal horror are trendy AF right now, but you get the best cut of E ve's music as BGM. Highly rewatchable IMO.",1512663397875085312,georgechen,6093272

Turning Red not only has (as expected) jaw dropping state of the art computer  graphics but it also capture the Chinese community really accurately. My only issues was the highly predictable story and plot line.,1506100032348438529,georgechen,6093272
"Mac Studio (Ultra) is a weird one. In some cases, I would have been fine with M1 Max since many apps won't take full advantage of the 2nd Core. The 64GB of unified memory is nice though. Swap is finally a thing of the pass.",1505302839869935617,georgechen,6093272
