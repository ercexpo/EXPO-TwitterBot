"Idk if Kirby Dach got hurt or was benched, but he only got a team low 8:46 TOI tonight. He was ‘benched’ roughly around the 17:35 mark in the 3rd. Not great. #Blackhawks #HockeyTwitter",1514815834832531467,WallMaz35,1071040913827340288
"I’m so happy, but also so sad at the same time. What a career for Pat Foley. Going to miss him. Hopefully we see him call an odd game here and there. Or just see him at the UC in general. #Blackhawks #HockeyTwitter",1514812107623059461,WallMaz35,1071040913827340288

"That was bad coverage by Kurashev, but Lankinen’s movements are just sloppy and all over the place. Not great. #Blackhawks #HockeyTwitter",1514799636854108174,WallMaz35,1071040913827340288
That was a BEAUTIFUL play #Blackhawks,1514798921251364875,WallMaz35,1071040913827340288
I think Alec Regula (#75 in red) tried to pull off this move again! Would've been great to see him pull it off against NHL competition. Regula is definitely playing with confidence right now. #Blackhawks #IceHogs #HockeyTwitte https://t.co/cXRRbdvcsU https://t.co/PV2JjL23jL,1514780167268315148,WallMaz35,1071040913827340288

If I remember correctly he wasn’t well liked in Rockford when he played for the IceHogs. I swear I remember him yelling after a game like right at a kid in the stands. https://t.co/NQcYO8QrDP,1514690747127189514,WallMaz35,1071040913827340288
I feel like people are reading way too much into this. But I also can’t blame them considering some of his other comments this past year or so. #Blackhawks https://t.co/0xZ1oMKKrI,1514650237582905350,WallMaz35,1071040913827340288
