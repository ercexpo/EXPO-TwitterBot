The Moskva sank approximately 19 days shy of the 40th anniversary of the last time a ship of similar size was sunk in combat. https://t.co/PMYEvfHvri,1514715429213818892,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064
"So far as I've been able to find, the last time any nation lost a warship as large &amp; important as the Moskva in combat was when the UK's HMS Conquerer torpedoed and sank the Argentinian Brooklyn-class light cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands War, on May 2, 1982. https://t.co/4eammDIHVX",1514715133574094854,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064
"And now Russian national news agencies are confirming that guided missile cruiser Moskva has sunk.

Whether their claim that it sank while under tow after the ammunition fire/Nepture missile strike damage was brought under control is true or not, I have no idea.",1514710929274978307,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064
The sense of offended shock from Russia every time Ukraine has the gall to actually retaliate against their invasion is just pathetic. https://t.co/3bKMbRVCI2,1514589634646487045,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064
"Perhaps even more important: Turkey has closed its straits to Russian warships.

So regardless of whether Moskva has sunk or only suffered severe damage, Russia cannot transfer another of its few capital ships to replace Moskva's lost presence &amp; capabilities in the Black Sea. https://t.co/lPhWJPVT21",1514444764418035713,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064
"The guided missile cruiser Muskva was not only the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet- it was also 1 of just 5 cruisers/battlecruisers in the Russian Navy.

This was a vessel that Russia will not be able to replace for 5+ years at minimum. https://t.co/XR5Upkj14K",1514437703387000839,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064
"Their defense, however, is still going to be crap.

In an AFC West where EVERYONE will be playing great offense, the team(s) that can't stop anyone are going to be the ones that crumble. https://t.co/EfAeUisGDC",1514296188983549957,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064

So the first time the Seahawks ever use the 5th year option is on a player they didn't draft. That's wild. https://t.co/Js6XwNDHoN,1513979965309689862,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064
"I totally get why everyone's crapping on Newton for this take. I'm right there with you all.

My question is: Why is no one crapping on Barstool? This kind of sexist BS is literally their main shtick, has been for years, &amp; yet they just keep growing.

Why the selective outrage? https://t.co/ptLwhNYHRr",1513899318939422721,tkothe_nfl,872499957483352064
