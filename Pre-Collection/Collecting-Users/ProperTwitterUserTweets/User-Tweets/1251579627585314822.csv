The Reds are scuffling and now Jonathan India pops a hammy. Total buzz kill for a super talented player. Hope he avoids a long stint on the IL. #MLB #FantasyBaseball #Reds https://t.co/nTsDgh5r4n,1514809946805731334,mjgovier,1251579627585314822
"One from the right, now one from the left for Ozzie Albies. I remember a time when I thought of him as a deficient offensive player. This is going to be a monster year! #MLB #FantasyBaseball https://t.co/6rf1v9llpc",1514805028392878084,mjgovier,1251579627585314822

"Anthony Bender gets Bryce Harper to fly out for his second save of 2022. In both saves he has gotten massive double plays. I love him, but I'm slightly concerned. #MLB #FantasyBaseball #Marlins https://t.co/S9Oo0myPh3",1514788611488509960,mjgovier,1251579627585314822
