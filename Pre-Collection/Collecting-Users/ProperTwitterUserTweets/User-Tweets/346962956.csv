These are the kind of games the Phillies need to win. There are going to be games like this where the lead is only by 1 or 2 runs.,1512928248224751617,musicnphillies,346962956

I'm going to predict Aaron Nola will lead the league in giving up home runs this season.,1508865136970371072,musicnphillies,346962956
Aaron Nola needs a put away pitch to get the batter out. He keeps giving up home runs with 2 strikes on the batter.,1507056107289731078,musicnphillies,346962956
I'm not getting a good feeling about Aaron Nola. I think he has giving up 4 home runs already in only his 2nd start of the spring.,1507052365190512645,musicnphillies,346962956
