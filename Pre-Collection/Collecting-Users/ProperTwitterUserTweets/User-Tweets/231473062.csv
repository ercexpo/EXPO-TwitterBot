Not a single Ravens rusher got 100 yards in the game other than Lamar until Week 17 vs Pittsburgh. They were ass https://t.co/VciYg3unOO,1512436552546279424,_SchoolBoyJ,231473062
Dawg Latavius Murray was so ass last year. No disrespect to him at all. But he literally just tried to run into people. Freeman was nice but he had no burst. Bell was washed and TySon was in the dog house. No way the RB room is that bad this year.,1512435821797859343,_SchoolBoyJ,231473062
