Steve Avery turns 52 today. Kirby Puckett has a present for him. https://t.co/d92vwnNnpl,1514571258872143881,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
There’s a chance Miguel Sano never sees 400 PAs again in a season. Too much of a liability in the field and in the batter’s box. https://t.co/6Or7Xa6u2r,1514451008851693571,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
Taylor Rogers: 3 games &amp; 3 saves for the Padres with no walks. It’s going to take a lot for me to like that trade. https://t.co/XuXMMm6jSb,1514445483246333954,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
"1994: The strike was just a few games away…Puckett didn’t care, high socks means HRs! #MNTwins https://t.co/pAwKggm4gV",1514407185580756999,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
"I couldn’t even watch the game today and I’m frustrated. Pulling pitchers early, punchless Twin lineup, releasing Cotton for a middling reliever who walks too many hitters, a 1B who is broken and yet another injury for Kirilloff. This is a very disappointing start to the season. https://t.co/aPK2iQswSF",1514357039438307329,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
One hit?,1514330544405942279,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
Too quick to cut bait with Jharel Cotton. I liked his stuff. Last night’s conditions were horrendous. https://t.co/hDIdpWbVur,1514280740061646863,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
Got to make that play Arraez.,1514069350868787204,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
"This Twins game has been rather annoying. Can’t get the hit that’s needed, use a rookie in his debut in a high leverage situation, terrible weather…",1514062427108913160,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
Twins needed to score there. https://t.co/By08w2jBaD,1514043090335580171,MNTwinsZealot,59595250
