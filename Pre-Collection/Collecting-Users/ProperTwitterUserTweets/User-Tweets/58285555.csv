Come on now. Anyone believe in this Sixer team and Doc Rivers? Love Toronto here.",1514074751265742849,TheCount1017,58285555
"Bucks -2.5 games -170  

Juicy and probably square but it's a horrible matchup for Chicago. Giannis destroyed them in the RS and I don't see them getting 2 games.",1514073174660435976,TheCount1017,58285555

Can't wait for this last season of Saul. I'm not a TV series guy at all but Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are the greatest shows in my 40 years watching television. Thankful to have had them to watch and look forward to for the past 10-15 years. https://t.co/pi4OqD0Roe,1513014849109823488,TheCount1017,58285555
"Why is spelling Khan correctly so hard? Were they not exposed to the Killer Khan/Hulk Hogan Saturday Night's Main Event?   See this so often from reputable big league places. In seriousness, just bush league. Misspelling anyone's name is pretty cringe really. https://t.co/GXnyo781KX",1513008892015353857,TheCount1017,58285555
