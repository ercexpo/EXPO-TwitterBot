I don’t even know why this is so complicated for folks but I beg everyone to please follow their local masjid’s Ramadan start and finish. Ask the imam at the masjid you frequent and they’ll give their start date In’Sha’Allah.,1509910518097657867,coudjoo,1353015529989136386
Yeah absolutely. I’ve done it many times. I’ll reschedule the date if my team is playing a huge match. https://t.co/B2xQaDIcx0,1509877639984594951,coudjoo,1353015529989136386
We are all “Ramadan Muslims”. We should all be striving to be our very best selves during this month and not miss out on the abundance of its benefits.,1509877239323807749,coudjoo,1353015529989136386
