a twitter hater said some mean shit to me about my album/general existence so i listened to her soundcloud songs so i could mock her back but the songs were really good ☹️,1512493480936943617,Bobby_Condon,2919015722
listen you can’t have white ppl shows (ex. perfume genius) at fully seated venues (ex. beacon theater) bc we will absolutely sit the entire show and the show will absolutely suffer,1512272960563912709,Bobby_Condon,2919015722
