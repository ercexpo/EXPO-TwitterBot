"With Nashville probably losing and Vegas probably winning, this is a big point for the Stars.",1514794803367534596,PatrickHayslip,394819037
Marcus Foligno literally just tackled a Star from behind with the refs starring right at the play. They're not calling another one for Dallas. https://t.co/JbpW3IYG2X,1514792420168196097,PatrickHayslip,394819037
Getting an eerie suspicion the Stars are going to need to kill off a penalty down the stretch. None called against them in the game is typically a bad sign.,1514791567390769158,PatrickHayslip,394819037
Minnesota keeps taking penalties but I get the sense the refs have given the Stars enough chances and are swallowing their whistles,1514788673937559558,PatrickHayslip,394819037

Didn't take long for Gurianov to get demoted from the Benn and Seguin line. He's been absolutely atrocious defensively tonight. Studenic takes his place and that line combo has been good in its short time,1514775960033189890,PatrickHayslip,394819037
Robo's hands are so underrated,1514774646167523338,PatrickHayslip,394819037
Oh no! But Gurianov is such a notably defensive stalwart! https://t.co/TYZEUFlM7v,1514761643821088768,PatrickHayslip,394819037
Dreadful start for the Stars. They were on their heals the first 2:15 of the game and Minnesota capitalized.,1514758952164249603,PatrickHayslip,394819037
