"If @wizards_magic offered to drop the Reserve List but with the caveat that the cards from it would only ever be printed on The List, would that be a good middle ground for collectors &amp; players? #MagicTheGathering #WotC #MTG #reservedlist

"Seeing Watson not only have any trade value but still get a mega-deal with Cleveland while still facing over 20 civil lawsuits for sex crimes is insane to me. On top of that the number of NFL players in the league with criminal records is nuts. #NFL

I wanna like @halo but ðŸš©were flying before I even watched the 1st episode. Writers never looked at the games &amp; it showed heavily in episode 1. Hopefully episode 2 &amp; beyond only get better. At the very least season 2 better lean more into what made the games great. #HaloTheSeries,1506900173909278720,Niickopotamus,4516959989
"Hypothetical: if @JimmyG_10 &amp; @bakermayfield both end up at @Seahawks &amp; @Panthers, the last 2 QB needy teams, do the rookies in the draft all fall out of the first round or do we still see any in the 1st? #NFL #NFLDraft #NFLFreeAgency #nfltrades",1506042005230600201,Niickopotamus,4516959989
I keep seeing all these transphobic responses to Lia Thomas compete and I'm just stunned these hate filled people aren't being called out more. She should be allowed to compete as a woman and has already shown she isn't going to dominate when she took 5th in the 200. #LiaThomas,1506019452965601292,Niickopotamus,4516959989
"I've been on twitter, and all social media less to help me break away from looking at my phone so much. It's been an experience. I feel less connected for sure but I pay more attention to things around me so that's a positive.",1498379273383682049,Niickopotamus,4516959989
"States are attacking voter rights. Seems now more than ever we need to make it a federal holiday so everyone is required to have off work. If we can't have early voting, Sundays, mail-in, then give us the day off to vote. #VoteBlueIn2022 #Election2022 #VotingRights",1487808938179534854,Niickopotamus,4516959989
"Anyone have recommendations for a sleep aid that knocks you out quick, won't put you in a coma &amp; won't make you feel like you are just in a sleep paralysis? I've had stuff that puts me to sleep gradually, stuff that makes my body feel weird all night, and stuff that doesn't work.",1485512348278444034,Niickopotamus,4516959989
