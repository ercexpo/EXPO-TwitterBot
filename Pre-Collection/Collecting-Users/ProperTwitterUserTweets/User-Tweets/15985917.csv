"On Cole’s side I don’t think it’s about the 4 minutes. The Yankees went with a no nonsense, anti-fan, Bond holder first, tight lipped off season. But it’s ok for the marketing arm of the team to let Billy Crystal goof around on the mound  before the most important players start? https://t.co/RteJQtwJak",1513166337652187139,AdamDunagan,15985917
"When is that last time the Yankees made an offer public? Today was a dog and pony show. “We tried, judge is the greedy one… oh and try to forget that our Owner said his obligation is to his bond holders”. https://t.co/Btm0KOagP6",1512455290423328770,AdamDunagan,15985917
No organization in sports deserves to have their corner cutting plans blow up in their face more than the #Yankees https://t.co/yLkJ4Oi8Ex,1512450633026228226,AdamDunagan,15985917
There is also no one on the 40 man who challenges hicks to stay on the field. Is his job ever going to be in jeopardy by Tim Locastro or Inciarte?  Hell no. https://t.co/QRo2RJ8B70,1508455460747321348,AdamDunagan,15985917
Feel terrible for the players but no organization deserves to fail like the #Yankees. This is was a Detroit Lions/New York Knicks level off season.,1505564347279491075,AdamDunagan,15985917
"The #yankees interest/pursuit of Trevor Story is fake until he signs and is in pinstripes. There is no excuse good enough. Not bond holders, Not Anthony Volpe, not future  commitments. Today is the lowest point of the Steinbrenner children owning this team.",1505221694507687941,AdamDunagan,15985917
In 2019 the #Yankees  refused to pay a 26 year old Manny Machado... In 2022 thier ok with paying a 36 Year Old Josh donaldson?,1503405926530928649,AdamDunagan,15985917
