Underrated x-factor of #Celtics vs #Nets: Ime #Udoka was just a coach for #Brooklyn last year. He worked with star players like #Kyrie and #KD last season. He‚Äôs also familiar with Patty #Mills from his #SanAntonio days. #Boston won‚Äôt be coming into the series completely blind!,1514285629890310149,celtics_weekly,1381261247006572547
