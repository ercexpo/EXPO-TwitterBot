"A word I always hear is ""Tipeni"". Used in a sentence: "" 'Oku tipeni foki 'a e ngaue 'e lava 'i hÃª lahi e pa'anga 'oku ma'u mai."" The word ""depends"" in this context, is properly translated to ""makatu'unga"" or ""fakafalala"". We have Tongan words, use them.",1509546283769364481,henryahonyc,19254862
"I realise it's difficult for most Tongans to stick to just one language when they speak publicly, especially when a statement is not prepared ahead of time. It seems we have to train ourselves to consciously think about what we want to say and how to say it properly.",1509545371764080641,henryahonyc,19254862
NB: Press Conference = Fakataha mo e Kau Fai Ongoongo. Use our language. Use English words only to clarify or if there is no clear translation. Make sure people will understand the English term as that's the reason you are delivering your message in Tongan in the first place. https://t.co/aQwQqg61Th,1509544686288920581,henryahonyc,19254862
