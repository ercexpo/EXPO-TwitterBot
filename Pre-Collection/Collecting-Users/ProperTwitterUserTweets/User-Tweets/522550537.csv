Just got the email to do paperwork for the morning job offer. I’m waiting to do it until after I do the other interview. I’m uncertain which job I will take. Should I take the easy one that I never worked for or the one I know that I have worked for? 🤔,1514658783263350787,Terena_Pickett,522550537
A phone call woke me up and it was a job offer to work for a company I worked for a few years ago. I also have an interview this afternoon with another company. Now I'm on the fence on who I should work for. 🤔,1514643216926228488,Terena_Pickett,522550537
