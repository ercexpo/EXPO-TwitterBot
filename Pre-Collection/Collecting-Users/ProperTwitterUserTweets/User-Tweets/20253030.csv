"The ghost of Steve Jobs, who is always on my left wrist, says I've walked 24.6 miles the last two days after 12.6 the two before that. No wonder my decrepit legs are sore.",1514102400767909891,justinjarrett,20253030

My dude @Brady_Sacha2 is a real one. Just started interning with us a couple weeks ago and already churning out daily copy from the Heritage. Only a freshman in high school! https://t.co/iSewY2MYRF,1514067994963550211,justinjarrett,20253030
