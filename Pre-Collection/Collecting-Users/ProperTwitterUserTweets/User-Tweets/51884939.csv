Do the Rams win the Super Bowl without Kupp and OBJ? Are they objectively worse off without Woods and OBJ next season? 49ers fans keep telling me they are worse off yet also keep saying WR isn’t a premium position or that Deebo isn’t worth the contract. https://t.co/sDwG8dVhDJ,1514668586366746630,richjmadrid,51884939
The lengths people go to twist themselves into knots about how they should make Bosa the highest paid player but not Deebo really speaks volumes about how people view the game and the talent that exists. And their eyeballs are lying to them if they think the scheme makes Deebo. https://t.co/vRLk97yRAF,1514667632917590017,richjmadrid,51884939
An $11 billion police budget with 3500 cops who work the NYC subway and they let the shooter flee. The definition of useless. Every cop on duty that day in the subway should be summarily fired and prevented from working law enforcement ever again anywhere. https://t.co/lmSXggBLLr,1514664269828157460,richjmadrid,51884939

"“You probably bitched about Lance. Then Deebo.” Does this guy know who he’s talking too? Not sure you do if you think I’ve complained about Lance. And I also think the 49ers should pay Deebo but go off man, I bet it feels so good to make shit up. https://t.co/gCIRiIpYdi",1514508103638650880,richjmadrid,51884939

"“What is the actual purpose of policing? If they are not a force for good, what are the police doing — and why do we give them billions of dollars each and every year?”

3500 cops couldn’t stop a mass shooter and let him getaway. That’s 3500 cops that should be out of job by now. https://t.co/ifOQyrVQyV",1514430815526014976,richjmadrid,51884939
