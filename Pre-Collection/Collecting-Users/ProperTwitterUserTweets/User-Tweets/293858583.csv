I really hope the ravens don’t draft Jordan Davis.,1514733957744578563,zeblack85,293858583
Only complaint with Hollywood is his hunger to get yards after the catch. Too many times I see him running out of bounds. I understand wanting to shy away from contact but that speed is a game changer. Love to see it once the ball is already in his hands. https://t.co/P8ETziFMVN,1514264220916932616,zeblack85,293858583
In 2018 ravens had the 16th pick…ended up trading back twice and adding two picks to then use them to trade back into the 1st to grab Lamar. Could easily see them doing the same thing this year….,1514205103141568515,zeblack85,293858583
