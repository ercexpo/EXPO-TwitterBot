"Not quite the YES #OpeningDay Yankee pregame extravaganza, but well-deserved, especially showing love to Tom Seaver with his long-overdue (tell @metspolice about it!!) statue unveiling taking place at 10:30. #LFGM #HomeOpener #LGM #Mets https://t.co/19luzjiM4m",1514751522499964928,NYCsporty,1185766026790592512
"Well, I actually went to see a #Mets game in person so I don't sound as much of a hypocrite promoting #Mes home opener tix at Citi Field, even though I probably won't be back to watch them in Flushing for a while. https://t.co/H3vsQBX4f8",1514700648314511364,NYCsporty,1185766026790592512
"Obviously, today's game going much longer than last night, although that for a 2-0 game wasn't much of a picnic either at 3:12, of course you probably didn't complain as a spectator of the game at CBP &amp; weren't going to sleep until much later after coming back from the ballpark. https://t.co/K1zIH5KIF9",1514347409329082368,NYCsporty,1185766026790592512

"Even when Pete Alonso thrives, Shannon continues his anti-Pete slander that has been constant ever since he said #LFGM in 2019. This is what ultimately will lead to the eventual demise of @metspolice. https://t.co/dWvBVIot6i",1514331197853339651,NYCsporty,1185766026790592512

"Dave Robert's is a great manager &amp; I'm sure he has his reasons for pulling Kershaw, but him dealing a perfect gm. &amp; only 80 pitches, this was a boo-boo by him, should've stayed in the game!! #Dodgers #LADvsMIN https://t.co/azFVSj1PLw",1514323591587848192,NYCsporty,1185766026790592512
"Man, we're racking up the HBPs..Plunk-Masters!!! #Mets will take it, but at this rate, it's only a matter of time if this keeps up that a team well &amp; truly target someone &amp; then #Mets will retaliate &amp; an ugly bench-clearing incident will ensue!! #LFGM #LGM #NYMvsPHI https://t.co/kxfv8bVaN5",1514310838324187136,NYCsporty,1185766026790592512

"Apparently, Max Scherzer looks &amp; feels outta sync right now. 2nd start as a Met, day game after a night game, walking 3 to start the game. #LOLMets #LFGM #LGM #Mets #NYMvsPHI",1514294499756974080,NYCsporty,1185766026790592512
