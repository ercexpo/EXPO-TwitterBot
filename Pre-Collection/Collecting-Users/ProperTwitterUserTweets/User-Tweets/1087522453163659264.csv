"Honestly, I think the Padres should send down CJ Abrams.
-Face 5 of 6 lefties next week
-His plate skills have been fine, but still lacking physicality
- Hae-Song Kim is the better option RIGHT NOW and deserves a chance to prove himself
What do you think?

"Best Bets 4/14
STL (+130) at MIL
CHC (+116) at COL
Over 7.5 Runs PHI at MIA
DET (+109) at KC
CIN at LAD Over 8.5 Runs
Model Thinks CIN is a Slight Value, Just Putting Out There; It Liked OAK Today too!
CHC at COL Under 11.5 Runs Also Interesting

"Really good to see Triston McKenzie's velocity sitting 93-94 MPH. Zero walks in four innings too! Would love to see fewer fastballs but this is a good start to what he hope is a season where he makes good on his potential!

"Padres Giants. Beautiful ballpark. Logan Webb dominating, Sean Manaea pitching well too. A couple of fun teams in an NL West match, what else could you ask for on a Wednesday!
