"They're bringing the N64 Mario Gold to Switch's N64 games list...

Which goes to show just... how much Super Rush didn't land... ðŸ˜¬",1514803635158339585,GodOfMoogles,749054930

I have to be Ring Kirby, don't I?

"The WORST licensed game from the PS2 era tho?

Seven Samurai 20XX.

It has NOTHING to do with Seven Samurai. And it's a horrendous futuristic hack and slasher with monsters and cyborgs and shit. It's... the fact it exists is baffling.",1514797520332853257,GodOfMoogles,749054930
Yup! Not only for the sheer ridiculousness of some of them but frankly: ya'll missing some EXCELLENT video games if you dont try some licensed tie in games from that era. https://t.co/tO4ZyzehhG,1514796175664160779,GodOfMoogles,749054930
"Got caught up on AEW Dynamite. My takeaways are as follows:

1) Starks and Hobbs v Swerve/Lee was fantastic and all 4 men are incredible.

2) Joe v Suzuki made my chest hurt

3) Giving the giant guy from India the same bad finisher as the LAST giant guy from India is... ðŸ˜¬",1514795423688323075,GodOfMoogles,749054930
"This is what me being a game collector devolves into.

Since @dphrygian mentioned the licensed game he worked on on PS2... I decided to buy it. But the vendor had a BUNCH of weird looking licensed games...

So I bought 60 bucks of PS2 licensed games. @PatrixRaider will get it.",1514793173465198595,GodOfMoogles,749054930
"Ads played on a video. 

The first one was for Jesus. Literally for Jesus.

The second one was a commercial featuring James Corden. Living proof that God and Jesus don't exist because no just or loving God would allow that kind of person to come into existence.",1514753701570916352,GodOfMoogles,749054930
"ðŸ¤”Do I dare get a THIRD replacement disc for this game just to see if all copies are just cursed in some way... not like that knowledge is anything I'd work with for any reason but at this point... in for a penny, in for a pound on figuring out this enigma.",1514749981760143362,GodOfMoogles,749054930
I guess I'll put a call out to @gamerave the master of all obtuse PS1 knowledge... what do you know about Monkey Hero? Is this game cursed in some way? https://t.co/IgZ2yCFDKc,1514749787182145538,GodOfMoogles,749054930
"I got a replacement disc for Monkey Hero and it's STILL glitching out and not working right. Was this game broken on a programming level, wtf. I cannot get a copy that works... this may merit some investigating...",1514747671851978757,GodOfMoogles,749054930
