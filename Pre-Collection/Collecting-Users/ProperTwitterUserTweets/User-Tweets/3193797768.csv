"One positive that comes from the Matt Ryan trade is ATL now has a clear path to take. The team is stuck in full-on rebuild mode now.

"As Kyle Shanahan has shown with the 49ers, his coaching has robbed his teams of Super Bowl rings. Matt Ryan should be a Super Bowl champ. He has consistently been let down by coaching and has never had a great defense. Look forward to seeing him with the Colts.",1505978316682977285,SactownRich,3193797768
