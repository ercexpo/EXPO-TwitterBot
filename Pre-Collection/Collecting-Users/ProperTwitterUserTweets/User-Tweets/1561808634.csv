Crazy IL weather. Yesterday ran in 60s and today in high 20s. Did 30 minutes at easy and mixed in a few faster strides throughout. Also did a few down hill and up hill strides. In the high volume/low intense second micro cycle. https://t.co/38wX8U9xo5,1514619002797973504,DrMuellersVoice,1561808634
"For me exercise is one large pill that builds capillaries, mitochondria, larger heart, larger left ventricle, larger stroke volume, lowers anxiety, and reduces depression.

"“Training the body, changes the brain, which effects the mind. Training the body eliminates conflict between brain, body, and mind.  This makes all three parts work in harmony.”  - Dr. Jason Karp. https://t.co/mxdtPBjyx3",1513846155544772608,DrMuellersVoice,1561808634
The last type of Periodization that I will talk about is undulating Periodization. This is where the training intensity and volume go up and down regularly throughout the training cycles. Usually athletes mix VO2 and threshold intervals with longer volume weekly. https://t.co/DnujByuezt https://t.co/DNl9U5Qehl,1513614890635829260,DrMuellersVoice,1561808634
