"MGK had the best of not 2nd best freestyle this freshman class on XXL❌🧢 It’s krazy how successful Machine Gun Kelly gotten since doing Pop Rock, but don’t get it twisted the man can still rap his ass off🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/OYqPYeT3uZ",1513378376479756288,big_papiMHG,3887572098

"Okay this haves to be the best one by far😂😂😂 Ryan Garcia should’ve easily knocked this guy Tagoe out. I like Ryan but for a comeback fight if you feel you’re the best go out there and show it every fight against every opponent, no excuses. https://t.co/MrzHTw0rEv",1513252066528952322,big_papiMHG,3887572098
"For those who actually thinks Ryan Garcia’s win/performance against Emmanuel Tagoe was better than Devin “The Dream” Haney’s win/performance against Jojo Diaz, you’re smoking crack😂💯",1513210973426921472,big_papiMHG,3887572098
"I’m on the Xbox Series X, I Got Some @Fatburger 🍔🍟 &amp; Handel’s Homemade Ice Cream🍦 because it’s my cheat day lol.

"When it comes to “boxing”, @maxkellerman should be the only sports journalist talking about fights and fighters themselves. Guys who think they know what they’re talking about like @stephenasmith , @ShannonSharpe &amp; especially @RealSkipBayless just need to shut up #Respectfully 💯",1512893562001637383,big_papiMHG,3887572098

"Stop playing with @Claressashields , she would knock out Savannah Marshall. Y’all lucky women don’t get to fight 3 mins each round like us men do, cause there were a lot of fights especially against Hammer where Shields could’ve easily stopped her💯 Put respect on her name #GWOAT",1510707578837213185,big_papiMHG,3887572098
