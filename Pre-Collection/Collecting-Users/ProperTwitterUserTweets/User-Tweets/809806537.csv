"A few night ago, I traveled back into Arlington to photograph the Marine Corp War Memorial illuminated at night. The American flag blowing in the wind and flying proud on top of the memorial is an image to never be forgotten!! https://t.co/QhH8njwBkj",1514392628313440262,lakeeriephoto,809806537
The Potomac River in full force at Great Falls National Park. I was hoping that the sky would’ve cooperated and given us a nice sunset. Unfortunately Mother Nature decided not to play nice!! @Gr8FallsPark https://t.co/7hwq585tZG,1514384437655621632,lakeeriephoto,809806537

US Park Police Officers patrolling the National Mall on horseback. I did ask if I could take the horse for a ride. They politely declined!!! @usparkpolicepio https://t.co/Oz6ieachOK,1514291576880648201,lakeeriephoto,809806537
"Tulips are in bloom in Lafayette Square across from The White House. While visiting, the public was able to get right up to the black fence. A pretty cool view!! https://t.co/Hr5Bnlxkvw",1514291561449902087,lakeeriephoto,809806537
More of the historical architecture that is all around the District of Columbia. They certainly don’t build them like this anymore. https://t.co/3wvJPb0Ly8,1514291423708958720,lakeeriephoto,809806537

"The Thomas Jefferson Memorial off in the distance. If you look closely, you will see the memorial reflecting in the waters of the Tidal Basin. The memorial is actually in Virginia. This photo was taken across the way in DC. https://t.co/qE1pR0g7xq",1514291241533546497,lakeeriephoto,809806537
Just 1 of the several military helicopters seen flying over the DC Metro area this morning. Definitely something I don’t get to see everyday!! https://t.co/8GYvmwLnPe,1514291103549337601,lakeeriephoto,809806537
A view of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial from the back side. The reason for this view was because there was a military ceremony taking place on the steps. Still a great shot! https://t.co/QWXs0P9Wiy,1514291038441164813,lakeeriephoto,809806537
