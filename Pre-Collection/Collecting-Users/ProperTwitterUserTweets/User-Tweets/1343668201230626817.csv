WB Discovery’s overhaul on the DC Universe is genuinely exciting. A clear coherent plan moving forward could create an amazing cinematic universe of storytelling.,1514690667393560582,CalebOrcutt02,1343668201230626817

Would not be surprised if we see Ezra get recasted after the film’s release or if DC shoots a new scene where Ezra is replaced in the end of The Flash. https://t.co/m4ed5Nk0rZ,1511753994745622528,CalebOrcutt02,1343668201230626817
Episode 2 of #MoonKnight is fantastic. Oscar Isaac is fantastic when his two personalities conflict with each other and the action sequences are great.,1511730636100354049,CalebOrcutt02,1343668201230626817

Episode 1 of #MoonKnight is everything I wanted as a longtime fan of this character. It stays true to its source material and is like nothing we’ve seen in the MCU so far. Oscar Isaac is already incredible as Moon Knight and I look forward to seeing where the series goes next.,1509226573064511491,CalebOrcutt02,1343668201230626817
