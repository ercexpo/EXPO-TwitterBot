"Looks like I'll be logging onto work later on Monday the 18th (work at home). I have decided to stay at Coachella later on Sunday as several acts will play after 5pm on Sunday. I had planned to skip out by 3pm, but Finneas, Maggie Rogers, and Maneskin are must-sees. https://t.co/4mr77AG8gz",1514682986146381829,ClubChalamet,1012439534145957888
"The director has stated that Going Electric will be made, the question is when. I'm thinking sometime in 2023.

"The Oct 2020 GQ photos are the best of TimothÃ©e because he's so natural, and at ease. The interview was fresh and informative. I hope we see more natural photoshoots of Timmy, I prefer these to all the crazy clothes, wild hair, and makeup. Those are distracting.

"This is not a diss towards TimothÃ©e Chalamet, but it shows how quickly his name is used as an example how well respected and BUSY Oscar nominated Timmy is. Referencing him is an easy go to when highlighting how heâ€™s in such high demand while otherâ€™s careers are going nowhere. https://t.co/5cKihgcQon https://t.co/MmhRW3ackH",1513183989879611392,ClubChalamet,1012439534145957888

"The sweet smell of success when you block pretend friend haters and they say nothing, but just quietly unfollow you. 

One person apologized, and we both parted ways maturely. 

Quality over quantity, ALWAYS! https://t.co/eyjbA5AeII",1512554149451161600,ClubChalamet,1012439534145957888
