"… why?

Stick Villar at 3B, start Nico at short, and drop Frank to 7th. Or lower at this point. https://t.co/qexkRYOyMQ",1514723197849149442,Marco_Scola,52453477
Why is Hendriks even pitching in this slop?,1514435183256252419,Marco_Scola,52453477

"As I suspected, Wisdom isn't seeing the ball well. 

Per Baseball Savant, Wisdom has chased 29% of pitches outside of the zone and made contact with 42% of them. 

For comparison purposes, Seiya has chased 2.9% of pitches outside the zone and made contact with ... all of them.",1514310489370771467,Marco_Scola,52453477
