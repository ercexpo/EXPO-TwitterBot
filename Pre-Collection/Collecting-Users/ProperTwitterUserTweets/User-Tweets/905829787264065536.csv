The Broncos need an edge and Paschal might just be the man for the job! @JRDrafts has been crushing it with these! https://t.co/af9A5DlMjw,1514650768003170304,Zach_Segars,905829787264065536

"This was a fun one! Think I’m a little lower on a couple of these guys then most of #BroncosCountry, but I snuck one of my draft crushes in too! https://t.co/DYYex0SicW",1514020271266668546,Zach_Segars,905829787264065536
"If the Broncos go ILB in the draft, Damone Clark is a name I'm liking more and more

ILB isn't a super pressing need for '22 with DEN's quartet of BB, JJ, AS, and JG, so they can afford to wait on Clark's rehab season, and get an awesome player for a bargain-bin price as a reward",1513899100835442692,Zach_Segars,905829787264065536
