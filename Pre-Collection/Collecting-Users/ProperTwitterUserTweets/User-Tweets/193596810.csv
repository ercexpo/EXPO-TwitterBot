Every time me or my friend Chris Treadway saw one of these “car into building” stories we would immediately share it with each other. I instantly thought “hahaha I gotta share this with Chris!” But he’s gone. RIP. So I sent the link to his wife lol. #ElCerrito https://t.co/pljyvDPpe5,1514729610843459604,soundslikepuget,193596810
"Sabine Pass is my pass. When my ship goes to sea that’s our pilotage. We exit the Neches River, into the Sabine River, out the Sabine Pass and drop our pilot off. Hopefully next time our engines don’t overheat and die in the fairway. Kinda embarrassing last time. https://t.co/lVFnyma9ho",1514710502869450765,soundslikepuget,193596810
"Good lord it’s been a minute since I’ve gone full Travel Karen but if you’re a Hilton Brand hotel called the IAH Airport Hampton by Hilton and YOUR app says you have a shuttle, you should have a goddamned shuttle. Why do you think I’m staying next to IAH? For the smell of jet-A? https://t.co/5KeCbwzCD2",1514707802832478215,soundslikepuget,193596810
"Ok I logged into the @hilton app and booked a room with an airport shuttle at IAH. I get here and the manager says “oh sorry there’s no shuttle anymore it’s in the fine print.

Why does Grindr describe itself as “LGBTQ?” It’s not for L. Why do we have to be so stupid and woke that these things lose all meaning? You know how many gay couples I know who met on Grindr? A lot. You know how many lesbian couples I met on Grindr? ZERO. It’s for men. https://t.co/tbS6Cws0jb,1514698460250968081,soundslikepuget,193596810
"If you have an airline club membership and you’re bored near the airport, with no same-day travel plans, on a scale of “frowned upon” to “banned” how pissed do you think they’d get if you booked a refundable ticket, went and had cocktails and dinner, then canceled that ticket https://t.co/HPZpXFqU9x",1514694965833650180,soundslikepuget,193596810
