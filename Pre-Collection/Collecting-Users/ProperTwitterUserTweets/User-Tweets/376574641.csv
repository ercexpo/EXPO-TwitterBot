Being a @hornets fan is embarrassing. I think it‚Äôs time to move on to my ‚Äú2nd favorite‚Äù team. @chicagobulls - you need more fans?,1514416036820434950,KevWatchedAFilm,376574641

"Absolutely embarrassing performance from the @hornets tonight so far. No offense, no defense, and no motivation. It just looks like they don‚Äôt care‚Ä¶it‚Äôs time to move on from Borrego. We can‚Äôt keep being the most average team in the league.",1514406668880261124,KevWatchedAFilm,376574641
The @hornets NEED to pursue a legitimate dual-threat center this offseason. Watching us get destroyed in the paint every game is not fun.,1514405740445900811,KevWatchedAFilm,376574641
