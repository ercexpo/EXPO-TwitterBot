"🍽👨‍🍳 In the end tonight on #MasterChefJunior the judges thankfully recognized #Grayson's efforts as Captain &amp; laid blame where it belonged.

Freddy made the most mistakes &amp; rightly so was eliminated. If not for these I'd have cut A'Dan for his power issues sabotaging the team. https://t.co/mcsowUe04Y",1514868769977352197,Neilfan12,29413215
"🍽👨‍🍳 On #MasterChefJunior tonight (Thursday) was great to finally see focus on my fav #Grayson with him as team captain. I thought he did fine. Not his fault boys weren't listening, A'Dan having power issues likely played a role. Freddy made most mistakes. Both played blame game. https://t.co/MZUlNG1wBb",1514861063203803136,Neilfan12,29413215
