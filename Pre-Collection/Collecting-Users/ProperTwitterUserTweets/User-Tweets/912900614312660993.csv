Baker Mayfield was disrespected? How sway! Was it not disrespectful to the TEAM when BM went to get a 2nd opinion so he wouldnâ€™t get benched? Lost his confidence but still insisted on playing? Dude is literally his own hinderance. Baker took no accountability per usual!,1514574462863163393,Dee_Trynt,912900614312660993

Every time he speaks he hurts his trade value https://t.co/lPsESqraqT,1514361085155028992,Dee_Trynt,912900614312660993
"The Cavs advantage in the half court offense is playing through their PF position via the high post. Okoro, Stephens &amp; Levert have to become threats via slashing. DG, Cedi, &amp; Windler have to be the main threats from 3pt. EM, KL, &amp; LM can all pass &amp; shoot from the mid range!",1514277847971643394,Dee_Trynt,912900614312660993
The evolution of Evan Mobley offensively has to be emphasized in the Cavs current half court strategy if they want a legitimate shot at winning any playoff series this year. Evan has to be the unchallenged #2 option. Then Things will open up more for Okoro &amp; Levert!,1514275389601988609,Dee_Trynt,912900614312660993
The Cleveland Cavaliers could not overcome a first quarter onslaught by the nets that put them up 20 after twelve mins. The Cavs only lost by 8 points after cutting the lead down to 6 on numerous occasions. Kyrie had to hit every shot &amp; KD had to really play Defense.,1514274436941291535,Dee_Trynt,912900614312660993
