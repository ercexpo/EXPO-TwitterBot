"Other than Kevin Gausman's performance, that was a complete mess from the #BlueJays tonight.",1514811487545540608,ThomasHall85,921013604
Sometimes you forget Vladdy is just 23-years-old. He's still got plenty of learning to do at this level. #BlueJays,1514803351484964878,ThomasHall85,921013604
"A much better outing for Kevin Gausman tonight. His pitching line across 5.2 innings:

6 H, 2 ER, 0 BB, 9 K &amp; 21 whiffs 

Gausman finished 1 shy of 10 strikeouts, which would've been the 9th 10-K performance of his career. #BlueJays",1514795315802476546,ThomasHall85,921013604
It's startling how much of a void Matt Chapman leaves at 3B when he's not playing. #BlueJays,1514787284586885124,ThomasHall85,921013604
"Kevin Gausman's splitter has been filthy once again tonight. He's thrown 15 splitters through 4.0 innings. #BlueJays 

8 whiffs on 14 swings, 4 Ks and a 53% CSW%. https://t.co/1j0UtRTfB0",1514784589771776103,ThomasHall85,921013604
"Oh Lourdes Gurriel Jr., that was all kinds of bad defence... #BlueJays",1514777301648433163,ThomasHall85,921013604
"Here we go again... 

Pitch Nos. 1 &amp; 5 were both outside and shouldn't have resulted in a strikeout against Vladdy. #BlueJays https://t.co/XwwI6UVx8t",1514775202311200776,ThomasHall85,921013604
"That's a wasted opportunity with the bases loaded. 

#BlueJays really could've used a hit from Springer or Bichette there. Instead, they fall to 0-for-6 with RISP on the night.",1514772045321539586,ThomasHall85,921013604
"Luis Severino better be careful not to poke the bear.

Getting into it with the #BlueJays bench isn't a wise decision.",1514766165154820097,ThomasHall85,921013604
