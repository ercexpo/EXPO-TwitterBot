Does anyone want to acknowledge Correa’s career ops+ is the same as Anthony Rizzo and even in his “career year” of 2021 that ops+ is the same as Andrew mccutchen’s career.

"Y’all treated reddick like he was good and didn’t suck when tuck might have won you the 19 WS instead of him, now y’all act like Correa was super injury prone until last year. Can’t imagine what will happen when it’s time for lee to replace Maldonado. #PenaTime #KoreyLeeTime",1505190272271101952,JeremyPenaStan,2594223312
"College baseball is great, more people need to come watch it with no Astros anytime soon",1500298685078507521,JeremyPenaStan,2594223312
I had to say goodbye to my little buddy this morning. His pain has stopped but will miss him dearly. Remember to show love to your animals everyday because you never know when the last time you can is https://t.co/BcLOSCKhcF,1498330634590343168,JeremyPenaStan,2594223312
