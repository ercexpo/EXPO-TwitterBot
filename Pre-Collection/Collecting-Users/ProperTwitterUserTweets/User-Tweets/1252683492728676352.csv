Not even a new takeoff pack?? This is so scummy. Your only option is to buy one takeoff pack for 50k and buy four more players from the auction house for 25k a piece (for the exchange) This is looking like a new low for Y'all @NBA2K22_MyTEAM. People can't even afford that man https://t.co/8DX2OqpiBq,1513912109842800641,Big_Wes97,1252683492728676352
