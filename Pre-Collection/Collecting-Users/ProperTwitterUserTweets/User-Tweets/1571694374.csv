#Jets George Pickens and/or Jameson Williams needs to be on this team. Football players get hurt but they have elite talent and they're 21 years old. https://t.co/tCxAhxvCVj,1512262246864404483,Phamiltonn82,1571694374
#Jets If Derek Stingley Jr is there at #10 are you comfortable taking him?,1510617808333414401,Phamiltonn82,1571694374
"#Jets What's everyone's realistic worst case draft scenario where KT is gone by #4? Here's mine:

#4 - Sauce Gardner CB
#10 - Jameson Williams WR
#35 - David Ojabo (or Boye Mafe) EDGE
#38 - Lewis Cine S
#69 - LB/HB/WR (Beavers LB/Walker III RB/Shakir WR)",1509609759011483654,Phamiltonn82,1571694374

#Jets I'll tell everyone right now if DK does get traded he's going to Green Bay.,1507787157909483520,Phamiltonn82,1571694374
"#Jets One of Jermaine Johnson or Travon Walker will be there at #10. I don't see 4 EDGE rushers going in the top 10. 

If they take Sauce at #4 I'm good with EDGE at #10 with a trade up to grab your WR in the mid to late 1st round.",1507076138987892736,Phamiltonn82,1571694374
"#Jets If Sauce Gardner gets past the Giants at #5 (they'll prob go OT) he for sure will NOT get past them at pick #7. All the mocks with Sauce going #10 are no bueno including mine. 

There go my dreams of KT at #4 and Sauce at #10. With these WR contracts I'm thinking one at #10",1507075193239449605,Phamiltonn82,1571694374
"#Jets I'll tell you one thing guys, with Hill going to the Phins and joining Jaylen Waddle I'm for sure hoping the Jets add speed to the secondary because they're going to need it.",1506762479602483209,Phamiltonn82,1571694374

#Jets Keep in mind when Mims did play his YAC ability was above average. He got food poisoning and lost 20 pounds so he was working from behind the whole season. If healthy and with a full offseason if they decide to keep him he can make a major leap in this 3rd year.,1506283775197646859,Phamiltonn82,1571694374
