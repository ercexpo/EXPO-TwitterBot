"Speaking of #CY_BORG, here's some stuff from when I was playtesting. The fracked out climate-collapse world around the Negacity (by my reckoning), among other things. https://t.co/a9e1QhwdgI",1514236550527205387,goatmansgoblet,1969483536
"#CY_BORG is out today, and it was a project I'm very proud to say I was involved with. As the content editor who gave it all a first pass, I was enthusiastic about how as a game it is a vehemently anti-cop/anti-corp/non-orientalist take on the genre that actually expresses agony. https://t.co/UyUnfpdjMQ",1514225900635709444,goatmansgoblet,1969483536
