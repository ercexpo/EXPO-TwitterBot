"Jalen Hurts career in Philly will mirror Donovan Mcnabb in terms of scrutiny. Unless he wins a Super Bowl, he was the QB most fans didn’t want. When he fails he will be met with intense criticism, success will be someone else’s doing. Feel bad for the guy.",1506235506597797892,D_P_Miller,1540778898
