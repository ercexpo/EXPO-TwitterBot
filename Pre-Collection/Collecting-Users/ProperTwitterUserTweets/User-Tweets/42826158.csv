"Now that you guys are on Apple TV+ to watch #Severance I highly recommend that once you’re done with that you also watch #ForAllMankind, #Servant, #Pachinko, #TedLasso, #DefendingJacob, #CODA, and a whole host of other amazing Apple TV+ shows. Their streaming service is excellent",1513639804725915652,RosanaZugey,42826158
Can we talk about how powerful Helly’s reciting of the compunction statement in the bathroom was? That was brilliantly written and acted. Talk about coming full circle. So damn good! #Severance,1512278030713974785,RosanaZugey,42826158
"I mean, can we give a shout out to Helly for having the balls to call a spade a spade…in front of everyone? Lol. THAT is precisely why she’s my favorite. 👏🏽👏🏽 #Severance @brittlower",1512247075194302467,RosanaZugey,42826158
"Forget Season 2, just go ahead and announce Seasons 2-4 renewal Apple TV+. Because this is one is where it’s AT! Everything good about television is contained in this one show. 👏🏽 #Severance",1509740442128199686,RosanaZugey,42826158
"As a Helly and Mark shipper, this episode was GIVING! 😁😁❤️👏🏽👏🏽 Thank you everyone involved. 😉 #Severance",1509714204361601049,RosanaZugey,42826158
"She got in that elevator and I was like, “For real?!? You’re not going to kiss him?” I was disappointed for a second (literally), then 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 #Severance",1509711202963795991,RosanaZugey,42826158
"What a way to ruin a historic #Oscar night. Back to back Female Director wins. First Deaf Male Oscar win. Best Picture win for a film that features 3 Deaf individuals in leading roles, and now all anyone is going to be talking about is Will Smith’s belligerence. What a damn shame",1508299897421791232,RosanaZugey,42826158
YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!! I’m so happy!!!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️❤️❤️ Something good to wash that foul Will Smith business out of my mouth. https://t.co/kdVRLWB8Ps,1508287566927187970,RosanaZugey,42826158
"Also, I really like Milchick. I mean, I know he’s supposed to be a “bad guy”, and I’m not supposed to like him, but I do. He’s simultaneously terrible and calmly reassuring all at the same time. Bravo to the actor who plays him! 👏🏽👏🏽 #Severance",1507220542750806016,RosanaZugey,42826158
"I mean, Milchick was getting DOWN! I’m kind of sorry to see Dylan go all psycho on him. #Severance I like how Helly and Mark saw that coming a mile away though. They were literally these emojis in sequence: 🎶😏🙂💃🏻🕺🏻😟😳😱",1507215824129470468,RosanaZugey,42826158
