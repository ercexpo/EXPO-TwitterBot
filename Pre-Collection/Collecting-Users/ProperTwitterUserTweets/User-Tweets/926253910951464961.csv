"Season hasn’t exactly started like we all had hoped but you bet your ass I’m still pumped for Opening Night at @TMobilePark tomorrow. Get to be there with my son, my dad, and my father-in-law. Can’t ask for a better night. Can’t wait. #SeaUsRise",1514809860063256578,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
Kraken aren’t making this Seattle sports day any better. Yikes. First year teams are tough. Mariners are always tough. Makes it’s a rough day. #SeaKraken #SeaUsRise,1514084971262087171,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
Poor guy got straight up Felix’d in his very first start. #ThatsSoMariners #SeaUsRise https://t.co/nqttWuHXRh,1514025144515104772,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
Brash was impressive. Real impressive. Hope the offense doesn’t ruin it for him and saves him instead. Don’t have high hopes unfortunately. I’m already feeling down 4 1/2 games in. #SeaUsRise,1514004896235761666,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
"A statement I’ve said way too many times in recent years…

The offense is non-existent.

Sick of that being the truth.

"Still on pace for 160-2, which is pretty darn good. Offense needs to wake up though. Like really wake up. #SeaUsRise",1513720623981158402,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
My 6 year old just went 2-4 in his little league debut tonight. That’s better than anyone in the M’s lineup today. I’m just saying. #SeaUsRise,1513709421137850368,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
Scottie Scheffler is on a heck of a run. Congrats to him on winning his first green jacket. Love that golf tournament so much. Wish my grandpa had been able to watch it. Miss ya! #themasters,1513293649471160323,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
"Anytime that Scheffler wants to show emotion would be great. You’re freaking on fire, it’s ok to smile there bud. #themasters",1513282892859797506,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
Unbelievable stuff. Love it. #themasters https://t.co/nujlphMfK0,1513276457954414593,WenSeaSportsFan,926253910951464961
