I can’t wait for the @Mariners to get home to T-Mobile Park. The ridiculous weather in the first two series has made these first seven games really tough. #SeaUsRise,1514689898267119618,tbailey1976,262185458
Way to go JK! Kelenic blast a 2-run shot to give the @Mariners a 2-0 lead in the second. #SeaUsRise https://t.co/FNo4lUiPRF,1514672702358888448,tbailey1976,262185458
