"State lawmaker of the ruling party says CLT won't be allowed to pursue better transit unless it's essential to attracting corporations. Since companies are moving here anyway, I'm guessing we won't get his vote. #CharlotteNC Attn @CLT_Urbanists @CLTdevelopment https://t.co/N89FWH8Jdq",1513610928608141315,brentgilroy,46109603

#CarolinaPanthers haven't made this story yet. But it's another good states-squaring-off tale. #Tepper #NorthCarolina #SouthCarolina https://t.co/9Vu3P7szXb,1513159813072625666,brentgilroy,46109603
"Outrageous. Basically saying ""Cross at your own risk; people are going to run red lights and that's just the way it is."" #CharlotteNC #cltraffic https://t.co/pRxgNsvT4n",1512516444088590343,brentgilroy,46109603
"Thread is a good read on Americans' attitudes toward #transit. One reason #CharlotteNC hesitates to run rail transit to our airport; leaders figure visitors prefer rental cars, because that's what THEY do elsewhere. May take decades to change these attitudes, unfortunately. https://t.co/ipFSV5g8a7",1508791256138330125,brentgilroy,46109603
"Ever try to get a fuly useable app anywhere but the Apple or Google store? Not easy, given constraints imposed by the tech giants. https://t.co/Qt629iTxL4",1506273210110779395,brentgilroy,46109603
#SouthCarolina officials are beginning to realize — You don’t mess with the #NFL.  #CarolinaPanthers hold all the cards in dealing with government. https://t.co/Xk4QfvS3ep via @CBJnewsroom,1506247665562099721,brentgilroy,46109603
Would @CLTgov even think about such a crackdown? https://t.co/p7INERSmK0,1503739738028744719,brentgilroy,46109603
"ULI, with broad knowledge of how transit and urban development are connected, says Charlotte's approach to the Silver Line is off the mark. They're right. We also need a scientific review by APTA, the transit assn, to make sure we don't build a system that can't attract riders. https://t.co/HfJICXTDbX",1501919429885628418,brentgilroy,46109603
"This review raises critical issues about how #Charlotte leaders have planned #transit expansion.  Getting people where they want to go, when they want to go, at an affordable price, is what transit is all about — but that hasn’t been the objective so far. https://t.co/93RMrutLJn",1500217207548223490,brentgilroy,46109603
