Bordeleau had a pretty good debut tonight. Obviously three assists made it look sterling. He was pretty economical with his puck decisions. Did a great job of supporting down low. Tried one fancy move in traffic and got stopped. Creativity is there but he stayed simple. #sjsharks,1514477384589664262,KevinLacy22,118884861

Jasper Weatherby has had two key blocks in the first 13 minutes of this game and continues to show a great ability to get his big frame in the lanes at the AHL level. #sjbarracuda #BAKvsSJ,1514430094575505412,KevinLacy22,118884861
"Thomas Bordeleau goes 2-on-1 with Lane Pederson, takes his first shot that Condors goalie Stuart Skinner can't track the rebound of and Pederson taps it in. Bordeleau's first point after his first pro touch! 1-0 #sjbarracuda!

"During warm-up, 5' 9"" Thomas Bordeleau skated up to 6' 6"" Vinny Desharnais and shared a big laugh. I can only think that Bordeleau said something like, ""Boy, you guys are a bit bigger here in the pros!"" üòÇ

"Condors are missing Holloway, Marody, Perlini, Broberg, Samorukov, Kemp, Niemelainen, and a slew of others. With Bordeleau in tow tonight, this is the best chance the #sjbarracuda have had in a while to end their lengthy losing skid. #BAKvsSJ",1514422000420229121,KevinLacy22,118884861

"I'm still a believer that teams should get some type of point for losing in shootout, which is a farce and a lousy way to lose a game. Whether that's in a 3-point system or a 2-point system. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è However, I've always said that teams absolutely should NOT get a point for an OT loss. https://t.co/LopW1DcMfA",1514309015236341760,KevinLacy22,118884861
