Used to break this one out every now and then when Bev was with the #Rockets. Hate on. https://t.co/jp0KkS3q52,1514112172363857922,don_dougan,1943671256
Absolutely love that call from Castro. Finishing him off with the high fastball was a great pitch selection. #Astros,1514106684792356870,don_dougan,1943671256
"Remember the analytic driven article two years ago about Michael Brantley's bat possibly slowing down?

Yeah. Not so much. Guy is a hitting machine. True professional. Hard not to love that guy. #Astros https://t.co/SN97qE4rHx",1514104531562516484,don_dougan,1943671256
I want to be like Uncle Mike when I grow up. (I'll be 54 next month ðŸ˜‚). #Astros,1514103988253343750,don_dougan,1943671256
Never get tired of watching Michael Brantley swing a bat. Beautiful. #Astros,1514092426616623112,don_dougan,1943671256
"100 followed up by 101 from Abreu? Yes, I think so. #Astros",1514081208136867842,don_dougan,1943671256
Brantley! #Astros,1514069001923698690,don_dougan,1943671256
Siri with his Cesar Cedeno impersonation. Great catch. Made that look a lot easier than it was. #Astros,1514062370229915659,don_dougan,1943671256
97 from Luis? That'll work. #Astros,1514059528932888582,don_dougan,1943671256
So glad the #Rockets drafted who they did. That is all.,1514051813879730179,don_dougan,1943671256
