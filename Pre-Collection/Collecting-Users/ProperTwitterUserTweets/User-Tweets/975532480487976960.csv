Druski saying “that’s gotta be racist” to Mario Judah is still one of the funniest things i’ve ever seen😭,1514826110634184706,whoisjonathan_,975532480487976960
screw it. i’m addicted to mock drafts. unofficial 3.0. love literally every single prospect. Kinnard can play tackle and be a great one btw. and Booker is a major sleeper this draft. i think this team sets up next years franchise qb to win immediately. https://t.co/iJHYTpJAL2,1514824635652751361,whoisjonathan_,975532480487976960
