My hesitation on the Sixers is mostly about Doc and a little about Harden.  Doc was terrible in the Atl series last year.  Im worried thats just who he is.  Im crossing my fingers Harden was taking a back seat to the MVP. @MikeMiss25 @TyJohnsonNews @Jennifer_Scordo,1514337399064694790,al_smuv,1094175851653091328
We gotta wait almost two months til they announce the NBA MVP...this gonna be a long few months.  And it sounds like its not going to be a happy ending.,1514282800324743168,al_smuv,1094175851653091328
