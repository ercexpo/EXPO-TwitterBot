If trump likes elections that always go his way no matter what the actual vote count is - why doesn't the prick move his fat ass to Russia where that's how they play the game?,1513955020617793538,MichaelEddy6,485206190
"I understand being thorough, but what the hell's Garland waiting for at DOJ? the Dems to possibly lose the midterms and the GOP Congress to cancel ALL the investigations into trump and his corrupt, democracy-destroying cohorts? DO SOMETHING MERRICK!!",1513951229789052936,MichaelEddy6,485206190
"Is it just me, or anyone else thinking Yankees overpaid for too many years for Gerrit Cole? NO pitcher - who plays in only about 20% of games is worth the kind of money they get. None of 'em.",1513950620818026507,MichaelEddy6,485206190
"Really wanted that sweep. But hitters regressed to last year. Leaving 11 runners on base. Loaded twice, no clutch hit, 2nd + 3rd w/ 1 out + couldn't launch angle a frigging sacrifice fly. Plus 7 1st inning runs in 3 games. Do that vs. Jays and we'll get swept 4 games at home.",1513574045471629316,MichaelEddy6,485206190
"On the record to follow metrics + NOT have Cole start WC game in Boston. Sox own our ""ace's"" ass w/ a 5.79 ERA against. Bad look for guy p.o.ed he had to wait 4 minutes for Billy C. to thrown out 1st pitch. Too soon to print up ""Who's Your Daddy?"" t-shirts like we had for Pedro?",1513572762543173635,MichaelEddy6,485206190
"Give Ukraine javelins. Give 'em Stingers. Give 'em planes. Give them whatever they need to pound the war criminal , civilian targeting russian bastards into the Dark ages. Put a bounty on putin's head. End this now.",1513259344435232768,MichaelEddy6,485206190
"Anyone left who fails to see that trump was following the putin/russian playbook for 4 years? Lie, lie, obfuscate, lie some more, create havoc and don't give a fuck who gets hurt.",1512896655351332870,MichaelEddy6,485206190
"If I'm Yankee GM or owner and Judge turns down the deal and wants 10 years, I trade his ass ASAP. Do NOT want to see 1 more of his pressers with his big head and baby teeth talking about being a free agent and 30 teams and ""Yankees are one of them."" Nope. You're now down to 29.",1512880762181271556,MichaelEddy6,485206190
Judge 1 for 1 and hitting 1.000. Maybe that's why he turned down a $213ML deal.,1512491945842511873,MichaelEddy6,485206190
Judge turns down Yankee offer of $30.5/ML a year for 7 years. He's officially a hump. Call the Angels - see if they want to trade Mike Trout straight up.,1512483955752124420,MichaelEddy6,485206190
