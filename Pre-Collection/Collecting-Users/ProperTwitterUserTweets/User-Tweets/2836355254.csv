I never thought I'd be that person but I fell in love with that routine. Got up super early. Went bed early. I just never had any energy after work and dinner and my workouts were terrible. I felt so much better in the morning. Its great to start your day off accomplishing that. https://t.co/ILJx7KadnF,1514940443095715842,JimKeith12,2836355254
I hate Beverley. Dudes such a goon. Ring or not Charles is a hall of famer. I thought the celebration was embarrassing. This is a dude who dove at Westbrookâ€™s knees too so I hate him. Except when he got Lonzo day 1 lmao https://t.co/fJydNUmRDe,1514780526455918602,JimKeith12,2836355254
"I hate Binnington but this Blues team is elite. I'd love to see them do some damage in the playoffs. Either them, the Preds, or the Wild I want to go to the final. But want the Panthers to win it all for sure.",1514775360071614466,JimKeith12,2836355254

Holy shit! I was here a few days ago looking at it. Im glad I finally did the tour on it last summer. They were talking about how they raised a ton of money to help fix the boat but were still well short. Its been sinking for a bit now I believe. Something mustve went way wrong. https://t.co/FPEDsFqPnD,1514621004332609538,JimKeith12,2836355254
