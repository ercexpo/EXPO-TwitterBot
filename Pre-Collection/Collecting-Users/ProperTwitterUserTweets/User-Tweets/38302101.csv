(Oh-oh-oh-oh) If you know, you know. This one is on my twitch playlist. Do you have a twitch playlist? What’s your list like? Mellow, high octane? Classic? Jazz? A mashup?",1514422373159784448,birdingdude,38302101
No Mottled Duck so far this AM. Report from David Chernack who shared that 1/2 dozen ppl have been looking since around 6:00 am today. This is not an easy Duck to pin down. @NYRareBirdAlert I’ll continue to share intel as I get anything. #birds #migration,1514208255194677256,birdingdude,38302101

"2022 East Pond digout #2. This AM, I joined staff from @GatewayNPS for 2 hours +, digging out the East Pond Northend valve. We had dug it out on 3/16 but storms &amp; tide surge caused silt build up. We have a good flow again. #volunteering #parks #forthebirds https://t.co/wViSqvnbu5",1513640314317291521,birdingdude,38302101
Mottled Duck hunt day 2. 1 hour and counting and nothing so far but my Ketchum Creek list just broke 20 species. I wonder how many ppl have misidentified this Duck. #chasing #rarities #Ducks #NYC #LongIsland,1513223357042503684,birdingdude,38302101
“What I learned on Tik Tok.” Is probably the most genius thing on @ESPNRadio - at least during the time I am a listener. Credit @gordondamer for this as I listened while driving from birding. Well done sir! I think the guys @TMKSESPN have to level up 😂@alanhahn what say ye?,1512929046182731780,birdingdude,38302101
"20,20,19 &amp; 35  @obitoppin1 #’s in his last 4 games. I truly believe it’s goodbye to Randle. I love the chemistry that I am seeing with the young guns.
