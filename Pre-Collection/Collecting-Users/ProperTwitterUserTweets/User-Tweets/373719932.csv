"Outside of Vlad Jr last night, this pitching staff has by and large collared the Jays these past four days.",1514788657311326219,Co2dy_Foster,373719932
"I sit and watch the Yankees struggle every night with RISP and if they ain’t hitting timely home runs it’s a struggle. And then I sit and watch the Brewers and I’m just jealous. They don’t expand zone, they don’t flail at off speed in the dirt, they shorten up and drive with RISP",1514736625540079625,Co2dy_Foster,373719932
Dang. My parents took me to Field of Dreams when I was a toddler. Haven’t been since. Probably should go now before they completely ruin it.,1514683120007667718,Co2dy_Foster,373719932
Been thinking a lot about this throughout this series and the comp is this current Jays lineup with Springer/Bichette/Vlad Jr/Teoscar vs the Jays lineup of Donaldson/Bautista/Encarnacion/Tulowitzki era. Probably go this current edition but crazy the Jays fans have been treated.,1514448811015479297,Co2dy_Foster,373719932
