"Most anecdotes I've collected re: parents getting involved in their childrens' sexual blossoming feature over-bearing mothers and their teen sons. In some cases buying Playboys, procuring escorts, arranging chaperones to strip clubs for them. What would Freud say?",1514692399343312900,gmgeiko,15347599
"The irony of a once-BLM-supporting corporation bested by grassroots organization without BLM support: ""Amazon’s defeat is also notable for another reason: the victory of a diverse group of workers against a mighty corporation that has presented itself as racially egalitarian."" https://t.co/LspLk9EsBL",1514691093446766598,gmgeiko,15347599
"Still find Jada’s “my Gran showed me self-pleasure” bit disturbing.  

I suppose it’s similar to the Old World practice of the uncle/grandfather taking the tween boy to the brothel for his initiation. I guess they are parallel but the former, more instructional, is more intimate.",1514679138547871744,gmgeiko,15347599
"How nice of the zeitgeist to complicate the sex ed dialogue with a resurgence of the Red Table talk in which Jada recounts her gran taught her self-pleasure. 

Whether coming from schools or family, what happened to discovering/exploring one’s sexuality as individuation?",1514616316035887117,gmgeiko,15347599
"Watched the Julia Child series last night, not my cup of tea - anodyne and saccharine. I now feel like a Martha Stewart cardigan has sprouted from skin.",1514615108718129157,gmgeiko,15347599
"Apparently noble intent, feminist uplift and hagiography do not a dramatic series make. They should have let me in that room. https://t.co/Xv1azp2jQ3",1514334231371071491,gmgeiko,15347599
"The obvious and chilling take-away: the subway shooter’s analysis, though articulated differently, mirrors the Afro-pessimism at the root of most anti-racism/DEI teachings. https://t.co/BX0LBd5e4o",1514315666291101704,gmgeiko,15347599
"In an ideal world, ""Lt. Governor arrested for bribery""  would have been the top 'NYC is f*cked up' news item yesterday. https://t.co/fQD53ZfbCv",1514311798907932677,gmgeiko,15347599
I can hardly think of better examples of casting against type than the mumblecore Safdie Brothers choosing Robert Pattinson and Adam Sandler... but it worked. Maybe Timothée Chalamet and Pete Davidson aren't  against type enough...maybe they are. https://t.co/Ch7igsLNO4,1514309468703662083,gmgeiko,15347599
"I've never thought about writing for children or YA, coz as I kid I didn't read YA or children's lit. I wanted to read the racy, challenging, adult stuff.",1514245897248546817,gmgeiko,15347599
