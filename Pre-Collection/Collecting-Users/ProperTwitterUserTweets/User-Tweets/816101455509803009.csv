Years ago I invested in a company making cardboard boxes. Boring and safe but i had no idea then at the demand now for cardboard boxes. @CelsiusNetwork is no different. You have to stay the course for the long term through these dark days. #Celsians,1514611158749093898,andy_gimino,816101455509803009
So i am formulating my thoughts on the @CelsiusNetwork news this week for a blog post soon. I have my own thoughts on it but i am just digesting it for now. #Celsians ðŸ’ª Still a believer.,1514555271095410688,andy_gimino,816101455509803009
Putting the finishing touches on a new blog post. #Celsians,1514369535163387907,andy_gimino,816101455509803009

On a positive noteâ€¦.shout out to Ron at customer care for helping my gfâ€¦.she is completely locked out of her account because the 2fa codes keep saying invalid when they are not. He was very helpful and given todays news thats a positive. #Celsians @CelsiusNetwork,1514071387702501377,andy_gimino,816101455509803009
