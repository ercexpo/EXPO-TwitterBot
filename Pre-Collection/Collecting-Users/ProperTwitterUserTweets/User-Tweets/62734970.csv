"Home plate umpire and first base umpire have both made bad calls in the Angels/Astros game. We can all clearly see that Tyler Wade was safe at home (should be 2-0 Angels) and Jo Adell was safe running to 1st. Instead, now itâ€™s 2-1 Astros in the bottom 5th. https://t.co/uWkaI42kmZ",1513273181854859265,MattAdamBenigno,62734970

"The Angels say they look to play postseason baseball this season. Now I know it's only the second game of the season, but if you want to play October baseball, YOU HAVE TO WIN GAMES in the regular season.

Also, they are now losing 4-2 to the Astros in the sixth.",1512637554977214464,MattAdamBenigno,62734970
"That was a bad play by the Angels and now they're losing 3-2 to the Astros. Come on Angels, get your head in the game and stop going after those bad pitches.",1512632554523750401,MattAdamBenigno,62734970
