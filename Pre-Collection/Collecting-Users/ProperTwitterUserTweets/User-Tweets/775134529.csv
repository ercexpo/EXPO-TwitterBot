"NEW episode of Pickaxe and Roll is up!

My thanks to @BradyKlopferNBA for joining me to preview Nuggets-Warriors!

I asked Brady big questions about the Warriors. Brady asked big questions about the Nuggets. Then, we made some BOLD predictions. https://t.co/K71wSWb0Vk",1514832633771040778,NBABlackburn,775134529

"Listening back to the Michael Malone practice audio today, I think two things are clear:

1. Denver will start Jeff Green and begin with THEIR stuff. Rivers prob won't start Game 1. Might change later.

2. Game plan needs to be dynamic. Warriors will throw kitchen sink at Joker.",1514730564275765274,NBABlackburn,775134529
"The general tenor at practice today was very business like. Less joking around than the day before I thought. Heavy on gameplan stuff. Heavy on ‚Äúhow do we stop the Warriors from shooting us out of the gym.‚Äù

Not enviable.",1514720217733103620,NBABlackburn,775134529
The pass at the end between Aminu's legs happened in the 2019 playoffs. It's probably my favorite Jokiƒá pass ever. https://t.co/S8KdEv9pGe,1514691249101443076,NBABlackburn,775134529
