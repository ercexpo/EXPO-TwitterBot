And the only to have 30+ pts in that triple-double. One of the few bright spots this season. A shame he was the best on the court at times tho. #Lakers  #LakersNation https://t.co/06dsyklxgI,1513988915111280653,J_Ohhhh,27391925
"BUT Broome &amp; Auburn make a lot of sense together too! I know Vols have been linked to Fardaws Aimaq &amp; I wouldnt mind that, but wouldnt KJ Williams &amp; Johni Broome transferring to Tennessee &amp; AU, renewing rivalry on bigger stage, make for awesome pairings? #WarEagle #GoVols #GBO https://t.co/zIt0BupFMC",1513952528945274889,J_Ohhhh,27391925
Obviously Julian Phillips should choose between Tennessee &amp; Auburn..prolly #Vols given they were original top 4 &amp; increased opportunity w/ BHH transfer. Other LSU decommit Devin Ree has been on AU radar awhile so maybe he lands as a #WarEagle? Also like transfer Curt Lewis 4 them,1513952497676734471,J_Ohhhh,27391925
tho I heard other names after BrandonMurray strikeout I like Kario Oquendo 4 Vols. They been linked 2 smaller/PG types tho even w/ 4⭐️ comin &amp; Ziegler. So Adam Miller &amp; Andre Curbelo -liked since HS. Or bigger &amp; PG- Tristen Newton. maybe former Vol ECU coach would give good word,1513952461345763343,J_Ohhhh,27391925
This could be a decent pick up. Too bad it’s only be a year. https://t.co/XFYOw5w2fV,1513952349957627917,J_Ohhhh,27391925
Farewell &amp; good luck to the scape goat who was set up for failure by front office mistakes. He wasn’t my top choice when hired but then he brought a championship 1st yr w/ an almost brand new roster. #Lakers issues aren’t on him. He tried w/ what he had &amp; the egos #ThankYouVogel https://t.co/jFPZMvlnFi,1513601360893292553,J_Ohhhh,27391925
