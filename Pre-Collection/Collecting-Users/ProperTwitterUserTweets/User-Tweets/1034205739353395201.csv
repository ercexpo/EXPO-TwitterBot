"Mom’s first visit in #Sacramento!

Three days in, three days of nonstop cooking and cleaning 😂

Sigh and can’t stop her, she brags about being a homemaker (one of the toughest jobs to me)…but her fun time…anyone see #MyBigFatGreekWedding? 🙄

Love you mom.",1514754751056949252,jaymzbishara,1034205739353395201

"As an $ACH #hodler since .02, I like this article.. 

It states how @AlchemyPay must prove its utility and benefits to stand out of the thousands of crypto coins and big competitors, like $XRP and $XLM..
