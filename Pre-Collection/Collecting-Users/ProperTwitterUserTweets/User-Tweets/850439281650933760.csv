Las Cruces High’s shining star. Could it be New Mexico State? https://t.co/Deo8HWeyyF,1514778986080923651,nateryansports,850439281650933760
"With New Mexico State guard Virshon entering the transfer portal this afternoon, the only players on #NMSU’s 2022-23 men’s hoops roster are:

Chi Chi Avery
Mike Peake
Doctor Bradley
Kiran Oliver
Shak Odunewu

Cotton &amp; Jabari Rice could still come back, but the Aggies need bodies.",1514739330962522123,nateryansports,850439281650933760
"Per @tobias_bass, New Mexico State has made the top three for Kansas State transfer Selton Miguel. At 6-4, he fits Greg Heiar’s mold of a sizable guard with two-way athleticism. Started 36 games in the Big 12. Immediate impact. 

Aggies up against South Carolina &amp; South Florida.",1514695542328102922,nateryansports,850439281650933760
I’d welcome this on certain mornings. https://t.co/FYqYqpDvD1,1514665243728748546,nateryansports,850439281650933760
"Happy to see former #UTEP assistant Nick Matson land on his feet. Was Rodney Terry’s #2 guy with the Miners, handled a lot of scheduling and recruiting. I know he still lived in El Paso even after he wasn’t retained, but now is back in the game after year off. Good guy. https://t.co/xPU8ziDxq4",1514643682430885896,nateryansports,850439281650933760

"STORY: El Paso's NFL QB Steven Montez (@Airmontez12) has been working out in his hometown, at the same place where he used to light up #HSFB scoreboards. As he breaks camp with the @Lions, he's reflecting on what got him there to start. @DVFootballOFOD

"Looks like North Texas transfer guard Jazion Jackson is eyeing #UTEP as a destination. Jackson started all 30 games for the Mean Green last season, including a 19-point effort at UTEP in February.  

Would be a major boost to Miners’ backcourt that has lost two starters already. https://t.co/fuKX9OMViE",1513597975716511747,nateryansports,850439281650933760
"TONIGHT @ 10: Former Del Valle standout QB Steven Montez (@Airmontez12) is training for the upcoming NFL season in the place he's most comfortable: his hometown of El Paso, TX. Montez will break camp with the Detroit @Lions in a few weeks.

Check out the story tonight on ABC-7. https://t.co/Pakc7AsjEl",1513304917347385344,nateryansports,850439281650933760
