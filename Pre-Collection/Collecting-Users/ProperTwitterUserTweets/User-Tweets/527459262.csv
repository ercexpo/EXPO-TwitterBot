Cardinal baseball won’t be the same without Yadi &amp; Wainwright.  It’s good to have Albert back for one last season as well. https://t.co/aDcT27ftBz,1512191310110896131,mleech02,527459262
I’m sure glad the @Cardinals don’t have a need for a 5th starter. And they sent down there best candidate in Connor Thomas this morning. #STLCards,1511059146329710595,mleech02,527459262
I’m cool with the Pujols reunion but he isn’t gonna make or break the @cardinals this season. This team needs to add another proven starting pitcher before the season in my opinion. You can’t go into the season with the lack of depth they have. #STLCards,1508387650394284033,mleech02,527459262
The @Cardinals continually draw 3 million fans a year &amp; yet settle for mediocrity. Nothing was done in the off-season to greatly improve there chances of winning the division or come close to a World Series title. #STLCards,1505559890294714373,mleech02,527459262
I think we all need to come to the realization that MO isn’t gonna do a damn thing to help this team out. Pretty much bringing the same damn team back that wasn’t near good enough to compete for a World Series last year. #STLCards,1505174223265935365,mleech02,527459262
It’s so frustrating to see the @Cardinals just sitting there watching these key free agents fly off the board while MO does nothing. This division is there’s for the taking. Haven’t given up all hope yet as Trevor Story is still out there but I’m not holding my breath. #STLCards,1504444713985785857,mleech02,527459262
Damn it.  I know it was a long shot because the @Cardinals are tight asses but I was really hoping he would end up in St. Louis. https://t.co/Rpj71sckyB,1504092992134656002,mleech02,527459262
My dream is that the @Cardinals go out and sign Tepera &amp; Schwarber but I actually think if they bring in a guy like Moran to compete for a bench spot &amp; DH roll I wouldn’t be to disappointed.,1502993594281562116,mleech02,527459262

Wow I can’t believe the @Bengals pulled out that victory! Congratulations! I’m enjoying my band wagon ride through the post season. #WhoDey,1487933248424529921,mleech02,527459262
