"Exhibit 2,928 of why baseball is boring. The MLB lockout would have affected my life zero percent. How could you yank him ðŸ«£ https://t.co/zOdJEgmLfC",1514324130027347969,MattRhulesSmock,1195112392717291520
Remembering that the Florida Panthers exist is the equivalent of remembering that @BarstoolBigCat has a second kid.,1514305577278615555,MattRhulesSmock,1195112392717291520
"If Sark is disheartened about Ojomoâ€™s comments, his priorities are all wrong. I actually like Sark, but to rebuke a guy for being critical of the team while saying how badly we wants to win, then that shows why thereâ€™s a problem to begin with. https://t.co/VAo01sNTWD",1513991227250774016,MattRhulesSmock,1195112392717291520

"The departure of James Akinjo (while I know could still change) actually hurts the team quite a bit. Weâ€™re left with one true point guard on the team, Cryer, who played off ball when heâ€™s actually been in the game this year. We have a bunch of stud shooting guards but need a PG",1509336206772998149,MattRhulesSmock,1195112392717291520
"I really donâ€™t get the idea that Kendal Brown would be better off staying for another year than going pro.
