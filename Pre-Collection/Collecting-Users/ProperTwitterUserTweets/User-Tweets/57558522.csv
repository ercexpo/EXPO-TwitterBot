"Nets biggest weakness has been the minutes with KD off the floor. Instead of staggering KD and Kyrie, I'd do the opposite and have a lineup of dudes who don't stop moving without the ball and can just get easier buckets/tire out a defense (Goran, Patty, Curry, Kessler, Claxton)",1514672658402660365,SamuelLachow,57558522

1) Alonso timely hitting

5) Defense is way better
6) Team has flexibility",1514328154348867595,SamuelLachow,57558522

"Chris Finch hid DLo on defense against Covington and some other weaker offensive guys for the Clippers, I'd like to see Nash do the same thing with Curry-Mills etc. against Boston",1514289059274715140,SamuelLachow,57558522
"Many friends from college are great, loyal, long-suffering T-Wolves fans. They have a fun team and the fanbase is as energized as it's been in 15 years. Congrats to y'all
