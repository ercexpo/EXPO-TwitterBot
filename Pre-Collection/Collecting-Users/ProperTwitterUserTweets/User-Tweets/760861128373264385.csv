"Baltimore goes down at home playing Carolina, but the defense showed up big in the turnover area. Here‚Äôs the play of the game for the unit: 

üëÄ Veteran LB Jacob Phillips on the FF
üëÄ Reigning DB of the Year Kenny Davis with the big hurdle on his trot to the TD

"(1/3) Setback Saturday: Baltimore goes one and done in the AFC Playoffs. We fell to New York on the road, and the game was well within our grasp. We had no running game, which really put a lot of pressure on the pass game. @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/3guXTb3JdB",1510225641379090432,XCFL_Reegs,760861128373264385
"Defensive back ‚ÄúWreck-It‚Äù Ralph Matthews has made the huge jump as a playmaker in year two for Baltimore. He topped the double digit INT mark with 10 INT, and is making house calls with regularity. @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/aqwOHo4YDx",1506463836970397700,XCFL_Reegs,760861128373264385
"KD leads the Ravens and the XCFL through 15 games with 13 picks on the season. Just don‚Äôt throw anywhere near the 6‚Äô3 beast, unless you are tanking like @XCFL_CoachBoone. @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/wpDwhwS7DH",1506104824714215424,XCFL_Reegs,760861128373264385
"Equally impressive is the DB unit of Humphrey, KD, Scary Cary and Wreck-It Ralph. The Fab Four have combined for 37 picks through 15 games thus far @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/WMyRT1Etnw",1506104512930590724,XCFL_Reegs,760861128373264385
"Tyreek Hill has been a revelation for the Ravens this season at WR, obliterating the previous statistical team records. He‚Äôs on pace for 2,000 yards and 15+ TDs at 31 years old. @XCFLNetwork https://t.co/dxcLXvoewk",1506103659846848516,XCFL_Reegs,760861128373264385
"KD. 6 interceptions, 3 returned for TD in two weeks. KD is 6‚Äô3. Coincidence? I think not. @XCFLNetwork",1500669635762528259,XCFL_Reegs,760861128373264385
Veteran speedster Tyreek Hill has meshed immediately with QB Lamar Jackson. The pair has put the league on notice with 900 yards and 4 scores in 8 games. Expect this duo to ‚Äúreek‚Äù havoc in the games ahead. @XCFLNetwork,1500249461964038145,XCFL_Reegs,760861128373264385
"This season has been nice developmentally for the Ravens. Our three big breakout players are:

TE Brendan Matthews, 24 yrs
CB Kenny Davis, 23 yrs
MLB Greg Ali, 22 yrs 

Great play from these three players compared to preseason expectations.
