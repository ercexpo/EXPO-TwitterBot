#7 #LFG Manoah absolutely buzzing off the mound after 6 scoreless https://t.co/z3sdhRwpFh,1513686585786703872,brettm1319,790051223131021312
Would be shocked if Manoah goes out at all for the 7th. Final statline will be 6.0 IP 1 H 4BB’s 7K’s. Command like I said got away for about an inning and a half there which added to his stellar pitch count early. But unreal first start for him FB velo up &amp; change looked great!,1513684850720530439,brettm1319,790051223131021312
Command has wavered for Manoah in past 2 innings walking 4. However his 5k’s and 1 hit allowed has kept #Yankees off the board thus far.,1513675546823208965,brettm1319,790051223131021312
3 and counting. https://t.co/lHVuJGmgqE,1513665624509239300,brettm1319,790051223131021312
What a start to the year for Manoah. LeMahieu and Rizzo looked lost at the plate. And gets behind Judge before providing a Jam Sandwich. #ManoahCYYoung,1513660033594269698,brettm1319,790051223131021312

Alek Manoah vs the Yankees tonight. That’s going to be fun to watch. 1st start on his way to his first CY young award.,1513538323519873034,brettm1319,790051223131021312
#WhiteSox are gonna regret reading Craig Kimbrel today won’t be the last of it. Hendriks is good. But didnt understand not keeping both and riding the hot hand. #Tigers showed what they showed at the end of last year…never quit mentality. This team could be special down the road,1512532549792321538,brettm1319,790051223131021312
