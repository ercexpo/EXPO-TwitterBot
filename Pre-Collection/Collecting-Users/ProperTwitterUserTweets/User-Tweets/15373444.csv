"This Sherri Papini chick who faked her death is gross. She’s racist because she purposely said two Latino women - in a town where 10% of the population are Latinos - kidnapped, tortured, and abused her before she escaped. $230K in resources was used for naught.

"Whoa. #TheColorPurple author Alice Walker was in a relationship with “Fast Car” singer Tracy Chapman?!?! She said, “the first kiss lasted two weeks.”
Walker says she loves everyone, men and women.

"I was 10 days shy of 21 years old. I passed it without issue.
