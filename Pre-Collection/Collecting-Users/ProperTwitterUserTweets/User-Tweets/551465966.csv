"I was in the building that night, and the entire crowd was in awe of Suh's performance. He single-handedly nearly beat UT .  This man was the greatest college DT of all-time and he deserved the Heisman. Period. https://t.co/HG3xbUIsjf",1514760035599069184,CoachStew06,551465966
"Just ate 2 pulled pork sandwiches and chips.  Immediately afterwards, I had a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  But instead of milk, I used 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.  I've reached a new low.  It's over for me now.  🤦🏾😞😥",1514758587192684545,CoachStew06,551465966

"Please stop asking these lists, bro.  Some of these dudes didn't even play LB in college.  Lambert went Kent St., not Tenn.  The disrespect to Andy Katzenmoyer, Navarro Bowman, Dan Connor, Rey Mauluga, Brian Cushing, Trev Alberts, &amp; Pat Tillman is laughable. 🙄 https://t.co/W8dbI4raLk",1514329348236578820,CoachStew06,551465966
I wish this dude would just stop making lists.  There's dudes in here who never even played a single snap at DE. SMH... 🤣 https://t.co/1aHyqX5VTU,1514200667497320455,CoachStew06,551465966
Charles Rogers at Michigan St. was one of the best college WRs I ever saw.  A friggin' terrorist to B1G secondaries. https://t.co/NQsSP08cO1 https://t.co/6Rbs7ew3Sy,1514026541256171527,CoachStew06,551465966
"2 is the BEST bite, therefore, I always eat 3 first and 1 second.  That way I can save #2 for last &amp; go hard with no interference.  (BTW, this pic just got stuck to the roof of my mouth...) https://t.co/FzgAwEQF1P",1513602297578016768,CoachStew06,551465966
