"Only 45 running backs at the combine have run 4.38 or better in the 40. Five did it this year which was the most ever in a year by far. Some names you might know, but plenty that only draftniks do. https://t.co/5zAEJDrxO3",1514677846568062976,ndjomo76,3353558471
Does being ridden hard during the reg season hurt RB performance in the playoffs? https://t.co/VnVupwl1N8,1514632297013731337,ndjomo76,3353558471
How much use is too much use for an NFL running back? And should the Broncos feed Pookie Williams the ball 300+ times in 2022? https://t.co/8UXTSgEagq,1514605315588689926,ndjomo76,3353558471
"Yards per touch for RBs can get skewed for guys with plenty of use in the passing game, but 5.6 per is still elite. @AustinEkeler has been amazing so far in his career - active guys highlighted. Interesting to compare run/catch for Johnson, Ekeler, Jones and Chubb https://t.co/iaDZdCXmqo",1514256193140707337,ndjomo76,3353558471
"2022 will be the 30th year of the 7 round draft.
A whiff is drafting player that never plays in an NFL game. Two drafts during the 7-round era had only 2 whiffs - 2008 and 2012.
1995 had the most whiffs with 41
Whiff rate has gone way down since roughly 2008 https://t.co/X95mIaBGzK",1513575146002526208,ndjomo76,3353558471
"Carries by age for the top 5 all-time, 6-10, 11-15 and 16-20. Not much on the other side of 30 with a few exceptions. The career arc of most NFL RBs is very short. All 20 of these guys were blessed and lucky. https://t.co/HCZfiywsZK",1512479882495803392,ndjomo76,3353558471
"Is there a place in the NFL for the heaviest of the heavy on the offensive line? Maybe, if they land on the right team https://t.co/6q6aDfZzgJ",1512449717740920844,ndjomo76,3353558471
How NFL teams used to value draft picks (for trades) and how some do now. When nerds and football collide... https://t.co/yxfJlx1dGE,1511789526611603457,ndjomo76,3353558471
A success in this NFL draft context is a pick that gets a second contract and was still in the NFL in 2021. Rams had the best recent block. Jets still in last place. Broncos about in the same rank as just using total successes. https://t.co/GPIVEiwXV9,1511760013815078922,ndjomo76,3353558471
Yet another way to evaluate draft effectiveness - quantity over quality. How did the Broncos rank? https://t.co/OpwHdgkDY1,1511713686762799105,ndjomo76,3353558471
