"2 things people say about @bakermayfield because they are ignorant, liars, or both - 1) He’s a me-first guy? Dude played hurt for 15.5 games last year. 2) He isn’t focused on football because of commercials? You think they are shooting those during practice?

Very insightful article. Cue the misogynistic responses from the mouth-breathing portion of the #Browns fan base. Sympathy to the kind &amp; respectful fans. #DeshaunWatson #SmartToughAccountable https://t.co/D30cE8jvYC,1505772820114071552,randaljody,19217799
Open up Twitter to see that the enablement of sexual predator Watson has emboldened a-holes to attack women like @AKinkhabwala. They are afraid of #strongwomen. For they are #weakmen. #NFL #Browns #Misogyny,1505761763270311939,randaljody,19217799
