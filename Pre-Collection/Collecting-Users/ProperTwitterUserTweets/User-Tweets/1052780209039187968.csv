"""unwritten"" rules in baseball have to be some of the dumbest shit in existence. A team has to be respectful and care for the other teams feelings if they are up big? Tell me, in basketball, if a team is up 50, do they stop scoring? Fuck no. Same with literally any sport. https://t.co/ivucEpAiw8",1514586076198981646,lumberjackallen,1052780209039187968

To all the people shitting on the wolves for being excited... May I remind this teams overlap win percentage... As a whole? Should I remind you this is literally only the second time since Kevin Garnett left that this team made the playoffs. We deserve all the emotions.
