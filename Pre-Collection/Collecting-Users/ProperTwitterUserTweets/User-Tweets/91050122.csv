"I’m loving this Cleveland Guardians ball club after the first two games now. I know the competition hasn’t been great, but our plate approach is outstanding, knock on wood, defense has been decent, and the pitching is Cleveland pitching, if they stay healthy, this could be fun",1514320919925194759,MarkModic41,91050122

"Steven Kwan reminds me of Michael Brantley and that makes me happy. He’s so discipline and sees the ball extremely well. I know it’s only the third game, but damn. Also looks solid in the outfield",1513260812479176710,MarkModic41,91050122
