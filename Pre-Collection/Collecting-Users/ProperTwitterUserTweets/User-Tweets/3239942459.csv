"Ya lost by 6 to the defending champs without JT, Horford, and Timelord in Milwaukee 😂 https://t.co/cFvnmaHS3Q",1514774547630755848,FrogmansWorld,3239942459
🤦‍♂️ Timelord doesn’t need to do that on this team if you haven’t noticed 😂 we got offense. Rob is Reb and Lobs and Defense. He loves getting the others buckets. Maybe you should read some of his comments or listen to his interviews https://t.co/Jwu1N41ZX3,1514774284341702657,FrogmansWorld,3239942459

JT 27ppg
JB 24ppg

Timelord double double machine with Giannis. So 2 double double guys in 1 lineup. But you think JT on Bucks is better with Brook Lopez and Middleboro 😂 yes I said Middleboro. Also PNRs and Lob city https://t.co/YLBlhaykoE",1514766820955238411,FrogmansWorld,3239942459
