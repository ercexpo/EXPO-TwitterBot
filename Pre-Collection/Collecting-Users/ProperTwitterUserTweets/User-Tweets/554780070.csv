Looking forward to watching @camsanders24 with @smokiesbaseball this year! He has electric stuff and is a pitcher to keep your eyes on! #ST2K22 #baseball #Cubs https://t.co/zxpx1YAMBx,1513305286185943044,biest22,554780070
Gotta celebrate people who have a sense of humor! #Cubs pitcher @ItsYaBoiWyatt came out to the quad one day with this shirt and graciously agreed to allow me to take a photo. #ST2K22 #baseball #realshort #WyattShort https://t.co/17ozLcD5dF,1512979826394640389,biest22,554780070
I got to meet @EthanXXVI in ST2021 and then follow his success across several minor league stops. He shoved in ST2022 and I watched him get the news that he was a  major leaguer. Watching his debut today with the @Cubs was amazing! Congrats Ethan! #jetfueled https://t.co/0CSgfTTOCU,1512936655144960000,biest22,554780070
So good to see Ethan make his big league debut! https://t.co/gQNAMbMplC,1512917115832991744,biest22,554780070
A trio of bats in the @Cubs system that should be fun to follow this season! Yohendrick Pinango @JamesTriantos and @ColeRoederer  #CubsProspects #ST2K22 https://t.co/hHeXmERrvB,1512654134847016963,biest22,554780070
The #Cubs acquired @EstebanPony late in Spring Training from the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for Harold Ramirez. Looks like Quiroz also brought along a bat from Randy Arozarena! #ST2K22 #baseball https://t.co/v9zh6IiHSn,1512594666721452033,biest22,554780070

"Story in 3 photos: I was in the camera well at the @Cubs game and witnessed first hand @EthanXXVI getting news that he made the ML roster. Hearing the news, getting congratulated and then realizing what he accomplished. Congrats! #hardwork #heartofachampion https://t.co/fLXhs6bLKZ",1511186591498203136,biest22,554780070
