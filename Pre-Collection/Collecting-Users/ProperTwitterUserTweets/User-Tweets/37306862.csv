What the fuck was that defensive series? Your down 6 pts. with less then a minute. You need to foul to extend the game? Defense needs to be addressed in the off-season no matter what happens Friday. They lost their focus and never got it back.,1514052634054955009,animallady43,37306862
Not enough weapons on offense. Guys not hitting shots when there needed. Then Durant goes down and scores on 2 straight series and makes it a 10 point deficit again. Love this teams fight but it seems theyâ€™ve been running up hill this entire game.,1514050007934058500,animallady43,37306862
Overplaying all over the court on defense. Out of position constantly.,1514048610073292801,animallady43,37306862
