I loved Jeurys Familia in the Madea movies. #phillies,1514056668224577542,scottdg,22176055
Sanchez threw at least 2 pitches in the top half of the inning that were called balls that were better than that third strike to @rhyshoskins.,1514049371498860548,scottdg,22176055

Hey @rickybottalico! You made the AppleTV+ broadcast. ðŸ¦Ž,1512581208085090306,scottdg,22176055

Nobody will see this so I will say it: vanilla Oreos with lemon filling are far superior to regular @Oreo. #UnpopularOpinion,1506666864558096401,scottdg,22176055
Tick Tick Boom is better than at least 9 of the best picture nominees. (Iâ€™m sure it is better than King Richard too but I wonâ€™t know for sure until tomorrow.) #Oscars2022,1506622773199790083,scottdg,22176055
Just listened to @jonmorosi talk about the Castellanos deal. Not once but twice he said that Jean Segura needs to improve for the Phillies. Segura is coming off the second best season of his career and played GG caliber defense. How exactly does Jon expect him to improve on that?,1505615639393808385,scottdg,22176055
