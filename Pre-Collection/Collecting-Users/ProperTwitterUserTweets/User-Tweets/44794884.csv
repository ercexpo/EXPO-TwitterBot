"Jesper Bratt gets one home off a feed from Zacha, 3-1 Avs. 8min left.",1514804980288421890,RealMatSmith,44794884
Wow what a FILTHY play from the Wild to secure that win in Dallas. Gaudreau on the long outlet from Flower makes a ridiculous move to evade the defense and buries it past Wedgewood for the OT win. That’s HUGE for Vegas who’s currently smacking Calgary around on the road.,1514796512848408590,RealMatSmith,44794884
"Rantanen has a new career high in pts with 88. Makar has tied the franchise record for points by a defenseman in a season with 82. Avs have tied a franchise record w/ 4 players who have 80+ pts. If Landy never got hurt, they’d have 5.",1514794393865101320,RealMatSmith,44794884
Avs cash in on the PP. Lehkonen gets his 2nd goal with the Avs but the first non-empty netter. He’s starting to assimilate very nicely. 3-0 Avs.,1514794007502594048,RealMatSmith,44794884
Helmer’s an interesting case study. Has had a good year. However when he doesn’t play well he can have rough nights. Can’t have those in the playoffs. Has to be that trade deadline effort every night if he plays.,1514793556556218373,RealMatSmith,44794884
Byram has to be smarter with the puck on his stick in his defensive zone. Some of the decisions have to happen faster.,1514791744667209734,RealMatSmith,44794884
Burky with a laser off a sick pass from Lehkonen behind the goal line as the net was falling down. 2-0 Avs.,1514790796360253444,RealMatSmith,44794884
Logan O’Connor FINALLY snaps the drought. 4th line goals. He does the little things so well. He’s so valuable for this club. Started so hot. Let’s hope this sparks a run.,1514788678119268357,RealMatSmith,44794884
