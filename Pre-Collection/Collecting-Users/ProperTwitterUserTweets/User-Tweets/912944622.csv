"EVP Stephen Jones said LB Jabril Cox, a 2021 4th-round pick, “Will fill right in where Keanu [Neal] left off.” Cowboys feel good about LB depth with Micah Parsons, Leighton Vander Esch, Cox. Jayron Kearse serves as hybrid S/LB. Draft acquisition will bolster unit long-term. https://t.co/LJQFyCBFKK",1511832346630275072,DixBrianna,912944622
"“He is the right fit defensively for what Dan [Quinn] wants to do,” Stephen Jones said. “I think he’s coming along great. Should be a big plus for us this year.”

"DE DeMarcus Lawrence: “I’m trying to be better than I was. I’m trying to learn from my mistakes, make the guys around me better. The year that I did have 14.5 sacks or whatever, as a team, we didn’t amount to s***, so what does that really matter?”",1507040967253237770,DixBrianna,912944622
"In 2021, DeMarcus Lawrence missed 10 games due to a broken foot. Upon return, he spearheaded the defensive effort along with Parsons.
