"At 6'7"", 253 Virginia's Jelani Woods is probably best described as a MOOSE in the open field. 

Wouldn't want to find myself in his path with a head of steam, think my hamstring may lock up before he gets to me. https://t.co/3Ju4Gi52LA",1514709075912712200,TriggeredWise,248036235
"Happy to get the chance to dive into the tape of Rutgers RB, Isaih Pacheco. He could be a hiddenðŸ’Žin this draft largely due to the play of his OL in college. 

Check out my profile on him for @Steelersdepot &amp; see what former #Steelers RB he reminds me of.

"Having a lot of fun watching Isaih Pacheco film. 

Dude gives 110% on every play. 

Giving up rough 6"" and 50 pounds here, it doesn't matter to Pacheco. He's still able to neutralize the defensive lineman (and let him know about it after the fact) ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/qmHcKagT3b",1513665434616221703,TriggeredWise,248036235

"Heartbreaking news to wake up to today. Having lost a teammate in the past, itâ€™s something I wouldnâ€™t wish on anyone. No matter how close you were, it feels like losing a family member.

Continue to keep Haskinsâ€™ family and all of his teammates past &amp; present in your thoughts.",1512950034798727177,TriggeredWise,248036235
"Without box score watching, Ridder showed some good in that Bama game, too. His OL was completely mismatched and made some nice plays when given the time.

The wheel throw was one of the best on his entire film. https://t.co/tgNIeESuK5 https://t.co/VUHL1lSgKy",1512486286883438606,TriggeredWise,248036235
