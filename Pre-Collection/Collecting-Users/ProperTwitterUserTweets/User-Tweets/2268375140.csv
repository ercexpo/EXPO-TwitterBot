Well it's always good to see #FilmTwitter trashing one another for likes or dislikes of a certain film that reviews are out for today - isn't there enough hate there already? Can we not just have one nice place to just be?,1513723674058129413,pegsatthemovies,2268375140

I think people forget that Julian's first album Valotte was actually a big album in the 80's being released only 4 yrs after his dad's passing. it was beautiful. He is an accomplished musician &amp; human being in his own right as well. This shines such a light on all that. https://t.co/HBmca2Bpp7,1513383732383608837,pegsatthemovies,2268375140
