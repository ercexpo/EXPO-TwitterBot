I'm going to this band tonight at a special show. @betterthanezra https://t.co/IQcZEiYdSX,1514689055518302216,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
great article by @edgraney of @reviewjournal on #RAIDERS Derek Carr contract. read it! https://t.co/CHmyC0ZAf4,1514404772488617985,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
Idk about Foster but Renfrow is getting an extension. https://t.co/IZKXcWEfq4,1514384275197636609,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
Well.. They want to pay Renfrow and Waller wants to be paid a lot next season https://t.co/ZhtaMyjO5b,1514376456071168002,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
"Carr’s salary in 2023, $33 million isn’t guaranteed until 3 days after the Super Bowl.....Interesting",1514369683486658566,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
Next up for an extension is this guy from the #Raiders The best WR in the game today! https://t.co/BvCnOgqR97,1514369171081027593,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
"WHAT! I thought he signed with #Raiders last month? That's what Twitter Insiders said...Damn..Well it's only a visit, you guys still stand a chance in guessing correctly! https://t.co/W9sTXiqzAf",1514361016829759493,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
#Raiders Denzel Good is Healthy now. He will be full go for Training Camp.,1514359849450102790,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
The Carr extension was happening either way...It's finaly over so no drama headed into camp. Now what do #Raiders do about Darren Waller? He will want a new contract next season. Tough decision since you cannot lose Hunter Renfrow and he needs to be paid as well,1514289253890600962,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
"My guess is #Raiders Carr extension  had nothing to do with money and more about the No Trade Clause which does that really matter? Watson had a no trade clause, he's on a new team. jAll it means is the players agent and go seek a trade",1514261526345134083,TheRaidersDaily,1626646135
