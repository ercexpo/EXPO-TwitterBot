I kinda want a TV series on HBOMax where it's about Thomas and Martha Wayne.  I realize while watching The Batman for a 5th time there's so much stuff a show about the Waynes could cover.,1514810333671526408,JDG919,1187732639136014346
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to wear my Zack Snyder's Justice League and Army of The Dead  merch because people might think I'm apart of the Cult . Even know I'm an actual DC fan.  Also sometimes I regret supporting The Snyder Cut movement.,1514803784328769559,JDG919,1187732639136014346
