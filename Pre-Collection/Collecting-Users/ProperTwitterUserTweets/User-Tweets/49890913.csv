Once again....Quin can't coach or make adjustments. The offense is so incredibly easy to defend when it's go time. Gotta fire Quin or trade him to LA or SA,1512644525486792706,TylerWelling,49890913
Never thought I'd see the day where Donovan Mitchell is the worst closer/clutch player in the league. He was so solid his first 4 years...idk what happened to him,1512643564492279810,TylerWelling,49890913
"If Tiger can get to -3 on the back, that'll be a solid first round for him. That par 5 really hurt him on the front 9.",1512129761165791259,TylerWelling,49890913
Ooufff....rough two chip shots by tiger on what should've been a birdie or easy par. That hurts.,1512118236501856257,TylerWelling,49890913
"Man, what a pretty out by tiger. No one can manipulate a ball like Tiger. So glad he is healthy enough to golf. Thought I'd never see him play again",1512110097689763847,TylerWelling,49890913
If this game proves anything...it proves Butler should be the 2nd guard off the bench. He is so much better than Forrest,1511885450142658563,TylerWelling,49890913
