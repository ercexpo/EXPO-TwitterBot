What happens on the car ride home will be remembered far more than what happened on the field.  Keep it positive - go get ice cream - laugh- smile.     It will be ok Dad https://t.co/w7WRUzll99,1514627830214275080,SCSportsReport,67658999
Love the @hornets but they must spend the money for a legitimate inside power player and add a couple of more pieces.  They cannot continue to live in the 9-12 position world losing games they should not lose during the season.  Anything less than top 5-6 next year is failure,1514608876326297609,SCSportsReport,67658999

Itâ€™s time for a national data base that will include every idiot fan/player that decides to physically attack an official or scorekeeper or tournament official for all sports.  Ban them from ever attending another athletic event as part of their arrest conviction.  Out of control https://t.co/CJl9iYcgz4,1513558185147351040,SCSportsReport,67658999
"Salute to @HRBullsBaseball on a job well done with Military Appreciation Night.  Having your players escort  family members was terrific
