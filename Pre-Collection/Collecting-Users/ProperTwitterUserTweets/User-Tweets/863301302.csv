"Child I had an in-person meeting I couldn't miss, but couldn't pull These Brundidge Babies out of virtual school especially with Cameron having Show-And-Tell.

"Since I got my RV I hadn't been on a plane, but when I tried to book a ticket on @united, after I paid, it said my ticket was ""processing"" cause I hadn't selected my seat.
