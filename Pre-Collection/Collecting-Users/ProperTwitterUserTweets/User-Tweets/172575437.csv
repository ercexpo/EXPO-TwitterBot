"2022 WRs that check the ATH thresholds have also been SUPER productive in college.

Romeo Doubs..
Jalen Tolbert...

Those guys make so much sense in GB. https://t.co/CiZwAjDxFH",1514793034327547912,JacobMorley,172575437
"One threshold we don't talk about as much for the WR position - and it is one TT certainly believed in. 

College production. 

Jennings, Jordy, Jones, Cobb, and Adams all checked the ATH boxes, but they were also stupid productive in college.",1514791832625967113,JacobMorley,172575437
"Rewatching the GB/AZ game. 

After another ST blunder and a bad drop. 

Amari Rodgers actually did some nice things. 

He looks like a different player with the ball in his hands as a WR vs. as a PR. More decisive/physical. 

Don't give up on him just yet.",1514788419691417602,JacobMorley,172575437
"Romeo Doubs - WR - Nevada 

Even = leavin 

Big play ruined by pressure

Doubs gets on DB's toes in a hurry. https://t.co/yjNS9nC97C",1514787615223934987,JacobMorley,172575437

"I donâ€™t think its a guarantee Sammy makes the team. 

If he looks good/healthy - Great! 

If not, weâ€™ll see.",1514685720585285637,JacobMorley,172575437
