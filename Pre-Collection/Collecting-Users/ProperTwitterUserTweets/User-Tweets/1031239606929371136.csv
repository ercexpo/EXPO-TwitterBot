"We all love Steve Nash, be was a beloved player. but he has to GO, he is not a coach. All you Kyrie fans, he must GO too! @BrooklynNets owners &amp; GM are responsible for this fiasco. How you trade James Harden for 2 players that are injured? How?",1510442362639732743,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
They won’t even get a free throw for KD! Just standing around looking. @BrooklynNets 🤦🏾‍♀️,1510427274868314114,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
Rest KD. Don’t risk injury for this group. Kyrie 🤦🏾‍♀️. It is always something with him. And I don’t know what happened to Patty Mills . Seth Curry is always hurt and Ben Simmons probably won’t play this season. And then there is Steve Nash. Kevin playing w/ the enemies.,1510417930223341577,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
Put Blake Griffin in. Steve Nash coaching is questionable.,1507900252870819841,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
KD needs to pipe down! Why he in the game. We up 30. We don’t need to risk injury. #NetsvsHeat,1507899761449447425,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
Why is KD still in the game with a 30 point lead. Steve Nash come on man 🤦🏾‍♀️,1507897493006209025,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
If they don’t take Kevin Durant out now. We don’t need any injuries. #netsvsjazz we should able to hold the lead for 3 minutes without him.,1506082553337425921,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
Easy Money Sniper #Kevin Freakin Durant #NetsvsJazz KD is on 🔥🔥🔥,1506076595588579334,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
Kevin Durant’s game is so pretty!!! #NetsvsJazz,1506074609141047306,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
"KD has a bad game because he has to use all his energy to psych up Kyrie. This is not going to work, between Kyrie and Ben 🤦🏾‍♀️!  It’s going to be exhausting to watch. Not sure what the #Nets are thinking.",1501395463899070469,detour2destiny1,1031239606929371136
