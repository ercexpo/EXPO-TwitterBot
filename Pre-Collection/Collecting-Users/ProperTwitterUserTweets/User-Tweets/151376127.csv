"When Maiocco asked Lynch on March 3 about whether they need the $25M a Jimmy trade or release would get them: ""There's certainly tradeoffs, but we've budgeted for a lot of different things. [Keeping Jimmy] would curtail what we're able to do, the aggressiveness we have in FA""",1506460010158563329,Jakeley_BR,151376127
Good read. The assertion that the 49ers should wait to release him is debatable. The benefit to releasing him now is having money to sign an FA now. The Niners likely won't have to pay the $7.5M injury guarantee (offset language)  https://t.co/tnA8vtPj74,1506291113350553601,Jakeley_BR,151376127
The 49ers had a great season in 2021. Canâ€™t take that away from them. But anyone who thought playing Jimmy was going to redeem his trade value should admit their error now,1505998175802314753,Jakeley_BR,151376127
"It's too bad that nobody cares about a QB's EPA per play when he has a decent O-line, great weapons and a top-tier play-caller. The last few weeks are confirming that the league doesn't think much of Jimmy G",1505987865146101760,Jakeley_BR,151376127
"I doubt the 49ers have an offer close to one second-round pick, let alone two",1505957836848730115,Jakeley_BR,151376127
"Once this goes down, it's time to cut Jimmy G and use the $25M on the FA market. I don't see any reason to wait anymore https://t.co/uWuQVT4cNn",1505957106209345540,Jakeley_BR,151376127

"Steph got doubled almost every possession of the fourth quarter, and though everyone is mad that he didn't get a shot attempt, I actually liked what I saw. From 10:17 to 1:59, the Dubs scored 22 points and would've had more if wasn't for two terrible misses by the refs",1499598183042727939,Jakeley_BR,151376127
