"So when I was writing for a buddy’s sports blog, I wrote up my NFL draft reaction. My biggest surprise was one @tyhoward71. Not because I thought it was a bad pick. I had just never heard of him and going and watching his highlights and seeing him grow in the NFL has been fun. https://t.co/eOnb88FHJT",1511787685970685953,CMTSportsNStuff,854029908649152513
"Seeing all the stuff about LeBron and the Lakers. Here’s my thought. And no, I don’t care about your opinion of the 2020 championship. Had LeBron not helped the Lakers win the 2020 championship, his Lakers tenure could’ve easily ended up like MJ’s Wizards tenure",1511786217066704902,CMTSportsNStuff,854029908649152513
Happy to see @AustinFC helping out with my hometown with this. https://t.co/NnDIO604DG,1511399482143002628,CMTSportsNStuff,854029908649152513
Stephen F Austin State University going to Duke and stunning them in OT. Never screamed harder for a basketball game in my life. #AxeEmJacks https://t.co/fAPVYBNiFn,1511021080399560709,CMTSportsNStuff,854029908649152513
Just here to say: Of course Beltran is trying to save his face since he now works for YES. The Athletics have officially taken the throne of Top Poverty Franchise from Tampa Bay.,1510732126861332489,CMTSportsNStuff,854029908649152513
Imagine still being mad at being bad on the road in 2017. Yankees scored 3 runs in 4 games in Hou but had 19 runs in 3 games at home. Astros had 5 runs in NY and 15 at home. Yankees had a 22-20 run difference in the series. But couldn’t do anything in Houston. Stay mad. #Astros17,1509594892577689610,CMTSportsNStuff,854029908649152513
"Here is my unneeded opinion this morning: I think it is great the USMNT made it to the World Cup. But having to go through Germany, Mexico, and Uruguay is ungodly rough. I think that’s gonna be really hard to clear well. Could’ve been worse. Could’ve landed pot 1. But still tough",1509557237743767560,CMTSportsNStuff,854029908649152513
So I don’t wanna ever be like ‘Oh I knew this player could be really good if given the chance to thrive’ and stuff. But god it does warm my heart seeing Drew Eubanks thriving in his role in Portland. He is such a good kid and he is taking advantage of his opportunity. Love it.,1509515408935632902,CMTSportsNStuff,854029908649152513
