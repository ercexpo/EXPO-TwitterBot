Did Harrell foul out of the game? He’s good against the team and I don’t think he’s been played much. #Hornets #Hawks,1514404670516645890,AngelaQueensNY1,38971431

#Warriors games without Curry are kind of tedious. They take effort to be entertaining.,1512964428718919684,AngelaQueensNY1,38971431
Doncic is very close to a double double just through one quarter. #Mavericks https://t.co/n5mGQmO7sC,1512597483343466502,AngelaQueensNY1,38971431
Sengun doing just one rebound through almost three full quarters? I hope the #Rockets lose. https://t.co/ciSACX3b1u,1512595730371915782,AngelaQueensNY1,38971431
Is Obi Toppin popping like this was the twist I was expecting for the #Knicks #YouGoObi https://t.co/9NCOKRpimW,1512595198865559553,AngelaQueensNY1,38971431
"Jokic gotta be MVP, again, this year. #Nuggets https://t.co/e4n0nLcpBP",1512270441016090624,AngelaQueensNY1,38971431
I hope Jokic plays a minute or two in the fourth to go over his Points and PRA. I was not expecting the #Grizzlies to get blown out this hard. #Nuggets,1512263905011191853,AngelaQueensNY1,38971431
Taylor is a bad psychiatrist. She don’t see the psychoticness at all #BoldandBeautiful,1512127310161489927,AngelaQueensNY1,38971431
