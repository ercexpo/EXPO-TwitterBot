Last time I checked arb $$ were determined by player stats. So there‚Äôs always incentives for players to keep producing even up 10 or down 10. Maybe someone should check if ‚Äústill trying‚Äù is in the unwritten rules https://t.co/5TeniKzU8l,1514643389748232192,JeremyIKaufman,1221254537509470209
"It was an extremely long winter offseason &amp; people‚Äôs passion for digging into the numbers this early in the season is admirable, but there are no season long trends or measures of sustainability in 6 games lol",1514595632568320010,JeremyIKaufman,1221254537509470209
David Cone is amazing and Vlad is unbelievable but no one in their right mind though Vlad should have won the mvp in 2021. No need for this hyperbole,1514393369505677321,JeremyIKaufman,1221254537509470209
Vlad got all of that baseball and then some. My goodness that was a shot. Stayed in the game after getting stepped on and just continues to hits dongs. Wow,1514392426861023232,JeremyIKaufman,1221254537509470209
"This one is on the offense. Missed opportunities throughout the game. Pitching staff has been really good to start the season. Minus the blowout win against Angels, offense has sputtered to start the year. https://t.co/cQcwzBsC3P",1514386858423242752,JeremyIKaufman,1221254537509470209
Pressly‚Äôs stuff is diminished right now. Getting out of this is an uphill battle,1514385128805609472,JeremyIKaufman,1221254537509470209
