"It's cool that Bacot is returning to UNC for his senior season. Great news for the Heels obviously, but better news IMO for college basketball. More kids should follow his example.",1514283551243575298,VTBooneG,98982678
This team is taking awful AB‚Äôs. Awful. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre making good contact (other than Olson and Travis). The starting pitching has been bad 3 of 5 starts. There appears to be zero options at DH. And they‚Äôve played 2 of the worst teams in baseball. Not a fun start @braves,1513699801661067270,VTBooneG,98982678
