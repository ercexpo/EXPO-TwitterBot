The inspiredly bizarre animated film CRYPTOZOO is a better movie and could have also been titled FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM. Watch that instead. Itâ€™s on Hulu. https://t.co/fKpCwvLvAg,1514397409366843392,Carlos_Film,786160586

"Yes GOOD TIME is great and UNCUT GEMS is beloved, but the Safdie brothersâ€™ HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT might be my favorite from them.
