The sadness of old stadiums that are abandoned.  This is the Met just 18 months after the last game of any type was played there.  It looks like a ghost town abandoned 50 years before.  Amazing how quick the disrepair comes without care and feeding. https://t.co/fGawz5o1wv,1514671050805633031,VikeFans,1621662402
Just give me John Teerlink (DLine coach) and the 1992 Viking Defensive Line and I will take my chances against any Line and QB. https://t.co/YQwsC8n9Si,1514670455554285571,VikeFans,1621662402
"In Wembley Stadium in preseason 1983, this photo shows the man who would take over in 1984 when Bud Grant retired - Les Steckel (3rd from left) and Jerry Burns (far right) the 1986-1991 Viking coach) who replaced him when he was a one year disaster. https://t.co/1YfrQtyRx3",1514670013642379267,VikeFans,1621662402
Rich Gannon (here in 1992 in a blowout win vs Cincy) could have been the Viking Franchise QB from 1992 - 2003.  We think the Dennis Green handling of Rich had too quick of a hook. @RichGannon12 https://t.co/FYgQLJI2Ts,1514669491329937423,VikeFans,1621662402
"When we think about it, we all know Randall McDaniel was great.  But, it is interesting how few talk about him as one of the greatest guards every - he played with leverage vs just straight bulk.  Never weighed more than 275 pounds. https://t.co/wzfB8gFzBj",1514347452446482436,VikeFans,1621662402
"Long since retired, here is Randy Moss in Green Bay 17 years ago.  The note - when we covered the games with the media for 7 years (stopped in Jan 2020 due to Covid restrictions), the guy on Randy's right was still security for the Vikings. https://t.co/D9evVuCWPn",1514347156827684867,VikeFans,1621662402
"Fans cry out for the $40M+ per year contract of Vikings QB Kirk Cousins.  But, all seemed happy when Brad Johnson signed his 4 year, $15.5M contract in 1997.  In today's dollars, $15.5M is worth about $28m a year.  Not a bad payday in an era with less TV dollars than today. https://t.co/eNVFx4Zztp",1514346731319832588,VikeFans,1621662402
"September 1980 - we all know the Met was a dual purpose stadium, but we wonder why they alternated the infield dirt in color for football games.  Was it to make it look like grass?  Seem odd when the regular grass did not alternate in color every 5 yards. Anyone know? https://t.co/vWtycNbz5L",1514345976366051333,VikeFans,1621662402
The first winter at Winter Park with the practice bubble behind the players - 1982. https://t.co/bS4Qnz8wV4,1514345251237945347,VikeFans,1621662402
"For the life of us, we can't figure out why Vikings OL Curtis Rouse was nicknamed ""the House"".  The first Viking OLineman with skill to weigh over 300 pounds. He is in London here before a game vs the STL Cardinals. https://t.co/qtKMjGvNED",1514345049802301441,VikeFans,1621662402
