"So glad Armando Bacot is coming back for his senior year. He had a phenomenal season (even when UNC was struggling early), he made the All-Academic team (take the fake class junk elsewhere, please) and he genuinely seems to enjoy college. #GoHeels",1514404055325589508,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
"Not a huge NBA guy these days but if the Hornets have a shot at the playoffs, I will do my home state duties and watch. #AllFly",1514382811851112450,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
"The Braves have started 3-4, with all seven games at home. No worry here but I do wonder if getting on the road will help. They have been patted on the back (deservedly) for a week. Time to venture into enemy territory (San Diego starting tomorrow). #ForTheA",1514379618492559362,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
Fantastic news. #GoHeels https://t.co/F1P5eyxAvO,1514274179050356749,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
I only passed through Baltimore a few years ago and doubt that Stan Stovall even remembers me. But he always had a hello. Heckuva career he is wrapping up. https://t.co/FcLF5YIOtp,1514025150240460807,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
Without telling me I’m a knucklehead (I accept that I am) what the heck is wrong with this slide? We might as well ask the runner to veer off and not even try to break up the DP. This is not good https://t.co/49B6TtIztk,1513681287801970702,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
The man is a Fulton County Stadium / Turner Field / Truist Park institution. Good stuff. #FortheA https://t.co/JO7D7fz4ww,1513663837060411399,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
The Rays are not doing well so far tonight at indoor baseball. 8-0 A’s. #RaysUp,1513660833510957059,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
So cool that the Braves are giving World Series rings to so many (I realize many other teams do this too of course.) the look on their faces is great. #FortheA https://t.co/mmsYXxkizT,1513657179483615234,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
"Braves fans seem unhappy right now. We just put up a World Series flag, handed out the rings and split with what might be a sneaky good Reds team. It’s going to be OK. #ForTheA",1513342967943213056,Chris_Vaughn95,25355211
