Omg someone replied to a comment about the dog on the couch from the podcast and said he’s tired from baker not being about to throw a accurate tennis ball. Lol. I’m dead.,1514646297462161408,djrbrownsfan79,719261120515719169

Baker calling out teammates for not wanting to win and being all about money is not being talked about enough. IMO. That should get some responses and maybe get the teammates to open up a little about what went down in that locker room. Should be interesting.,1514585008622772225,djrbrownsfan79,719261120515719169
#Browns need to wish Baker a Happy Birthday today. Please!  Ultimate move.,1514580653467176961,djrbrownsfan79,719261120515719169
Browns players listening to Baker talk shit and boast after throwing 4 interceptions in the first half. https://t.co/yjidL8rD8n,1514295149299666945,djrbrownsfan79,719261120515719169
