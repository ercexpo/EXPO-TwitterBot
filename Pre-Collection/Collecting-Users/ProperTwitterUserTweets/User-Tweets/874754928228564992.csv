It's very telling and I don't see many pointing it out that in Scooter Message He talks about how his friends(I'm guessing his grown ass adult friends) are ready to attack Kid Laroi and that's very telling and I don't think Scooter realizes how Telling that is. https://t.co/LQeygBNVp1,1514753420896391173,movie_charles,874754928228564992
