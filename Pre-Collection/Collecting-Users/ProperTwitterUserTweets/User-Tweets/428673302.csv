"The Twins season is 5 games old. Opening Day, Saturday’s loss, and tonight have all been excruciating. A few small things go differently and they are 5-0, easily. 

But, they’re about to drop to 2-3. 

Could take it as a positive, I suppose.",1514071232592977924,andluedtke,428673302
"If the Twins pitching could throw in a 40° rainy weather environment all year while the Twins offense hit in a 75° and sunny environment, they’d be unstoppable.",1514062953707941888,andluedtke,428673302
"If the Twins scored in the 5th or the 6th to take the lead, would this game have ended?",1514059773376933895,andluedtke,428673302

"I’m coaching at a baseball tournament in Des Moines. We have a 4 hour break between games so I’m posted up at a random Starbucks listening to the @TwinsRadio broadcast. 

I’ve been audibly celebrating each Twins homer today. These workers might kick me out. LOL. 

Let’s go, Buck!",1513228813026705417,andluedtke,428673302
"I mean, sure it sucks to allow 2 in the ninth. How about not giving up extra base hits on 2-strike counts (happened on 0-2 and 2-2), being retired 16 times in a row, and cutting balls off in the gap to hold runners to singles. A lot of little things cost them, not just the 9th.",1512905088603500547,andluedtke,428673302
"Twins were 5 feet away from winning yesterday. One pitch away from closing it out today. 

Tough.",1512901500212817925,andluedtke,428673302
One-run lead going into the bottom of the 9th. Perfect time to go to Taylor Rogers.,1512898468775354369,andluedtke,428673302
