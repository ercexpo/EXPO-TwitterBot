"Philly fans. (Sigh.) So instead of an adult response, he calls a person he doesn’t know names. Well, horse face is a first. https://t.co/Ep5oia2Km2",1514715714938028032,annabrice,27367086
"Two things I don't like about today's baseball - 

Taking out a guy who's pitching a perfect game thru 7 (&amp; only 80 pitches). Then still bringing in 2 more pitchers.

Games with 12 pitchers in it (Mets/Phillies today). 13 pitchers (Astros/Dbacks). 3 games with 10 pitchers in it.",1514487577146912769,annabrice,27367086

"Between His impression of Jacob deGrom &amp; now giving him bat CPR, he seems to be pretty funny. https://t.co/3cLrFpGRLI",1513996496496037888,annabrice,27367086
That was awesome from a pitcher. But you know. He could get hurt. I think there should be designated fielders for pitchers. https://t.co/nVGmNbNecw,1513995583060529152,annabrice,27367086
6 if it’s chocolate under the sprinkles. Otherwise 2. But I do like rainbow sprinkles (but it must be chocolate frosting). https://t.co/S4A8fJEY3d,1513990954818015235,annabrice,27367086
