You wanna talk about a fit for the #Steelers look no farther than Christian Watson. Size and speed to dominate in the Z role. Keep an eye on him in the second round https://t.co/awQvaOtEBK,1513842962345521154,FalceAndrew,1236135174754177029
Devastating news from the #Steelers today. Thoughts and prayers to the Haskins family. Horribly sad news,1512819234560163845,FalceAndrew,1236135174754177029
Third favorite QB in the class. He needs to be in the right system to me. I think Tennessee would be a good offense for him to sit for a year and take over from Tannehill https://t.co/WRzJnHuage,1509531761520230410,FalceAndrew,1236135174754177029
Quality depth piece. Curious what the cost is https://t.co/Dz5YZM6M2A,1508553894246371335,FalceAndrew,1236135174754177029
"I wouldn’t say crickets. That said, Pitt isn’t exactly a far drive for the #Steelers lol. They also have other draftable prospects. Liberty is literally all for Malik. https://t.co/JPDQR0fVE6",1506357757305405443,FalceAndrew,1236135174754177029
Can’t underestimate how huge this is. Expect an aggressive move up to try and land him #Steelers https://t.co/1AEEJ9ApWv,1506312797382234121,FalceAndrew,1236135174754177029
"I’m not saying but I’m just saying, if a guy like this falls to the #Steelers in the second round, he’s a no brainier add. I feel horrible for the guy, but he is a freak talent https://t.co/3zKbvFh9wn",1505187330671398923,FalceAndrew,1236135174754177029
