"I legitimately do not know how Bobby Marks is paid for his opinions. Has some of the worst sports takes, maybe of all time.

Capologist or not, please do not let him make any more lists, rankings, or big boards @espn.",1513927975657525249,Hamburgrler,184092618
A reminder that Gotham is literally based on NYC. And NYC continues to show why.,1513892865738526727,Hamburgrler,184092618

On the record. Let it be known.",1513323170073358338,Hamburgrler,184092618

Yankees have gone through 4 pitchers through 6 innings.

Cole is paid $300mil and they won’t let him go 90 pitches. Just insane. Stop micro-managing and let’s the stars plays.",1512507343606591499,Hamburgrler,184092618

"The Knicks’ season is over. Pretty, pretty, pretty bumpy year for the team.

RJ took a big step forward and although it’s a consolation prize, we fans can hang our hats on that.",1509717620047626241,Hamburgrler,184092618
