"Sam Williams with the sack. Great burst and first step off the LOS. Gets the RT leaning forward, he extends his arms and gets the edge. Great combination of strength, length, and burst. @ArrowheadLive https://t.co/rM3ZxQe2ZM",1514811507917262853,CJScoobs,4258691026
Charles Cross vs Sam Williams. High-level play by both. Williams initially wins by countering inside and getting the hand leverage battle. Cross counters by setting down hard and gets the inside hand on Williams slowing the power. Premiere matchup. @ArrowheadLive https://t.co/7mRJSLlScN,1514805042250870792,CJScoobs,4258691026
AB vs Chiefs Twitter would be a prize fight. https://t.co/qK9ppP3mVH,1514753518132899851,CJScoobs,4258691026
As much as I like Deebo you can’t give up more than what you got for Tyreek. https://t.co/bxzOw7fWFC,1514693076538769416,CJScoobs,4258691026

Want to know the best way to get people to look at your mock draft? Say the Chiefs will move up multiple slots for one of the premiere WR talents.,1514000878184849418,CJScoobs,4258691026
They need to start limiting the amount of reps he spends as an in-line blocker. They also need someone who can run block consistently but teams will still have to account for in the passing game. Seems like a way to extend Kelce’s career. https://t.co/ZZ0W4qeXbY,1513909819274665993,CJScoobs,4258691026
Jelani Woods bulldozes his way to the endzone on this play. Such a quick release off the LOS and great job getting vertical. Shows off the catch radius and the strength in the open field. Big time YAC ability.  @ArrowheadLive https://t.co/9WrN6ZGwoa,1513552959279403014,CJScoobs,4258691026
