Hey @MoEgger if I gotta be honest you're definitely more entertaining than Lance McAlister. https://t.co/lBk9CulLsN,1514701767514198018,eyeamRandy,39674729
Great reaction! 👏 https://t.co/TZruF37UAp,1514697332629164042,eyeamRandy,39674729
#AEWDynamite was great tonight and Joe winning the #ROH TV Title was cool but that ending with that giant dude showing up kinda deflated the end of the show. Besides that it was very enjoyable.,1514449878725935110,eyeamRandy,39674729
"#Reds attendance today is just a bit over 10,000. 
Looks like about 35,000 people found something else to do Phil Castellini. https://t.co/KF2oahcBJQ",1514336128719020041,eyeamRandy,39674729
"I honestly like watching @bryandanielson wrestle in @AEW better than I did when he was in WWE because he's so much more violent now.

"So when hospital bill collectors call for Kellie I've decided that from now on I'm going to just yell ""Keep my wife's name out your f*cking mouth!"".

I can'twait to see @joseph_ossai on the field this coming season for the Bengals. He's going to be fired up coming back from injury to help a team that just won the AFC. 💪 #WhoDey https://t.co/Qh9dG3cmRX,1507337649497030660,eyeamRandy,39674729
This is the 3rd year in a row Cincinnati has spent money in free agency. There's absolutely no doubt that Mike Brown with massive help from his daughter Katie Blackburn has built a team that will compete in the playoffs and for the Super Bowl for many years to come. #WhoDey 🐅 https://t.co/3eSfs8I4bc,1506018487449407495,eyeamRandy,39674729
