"But we can’t string that together consecutively . Good hitting and pitching 

I’m just ready for the return of Ronald Acuña Junior.",1514770668352679936,JORDAN23H,25641157
The Braves won the World Series last year so I’m going to give them some grace. But eight games into the season it seems one game we don’t pitch good and  will lose. The next game we pitch well and our offense comes up strong and we win. ￼,1514770653458710530,JORDAN23H,25641157
"They won’t ever build a consistent playoff contending team.

Thank God ATL has the Braves because the Falcons and Hawks ain’t it",1514428309781848067,JORDAN23H,25641157
The Hawks are playoff Pretenders. They don’t scare anyone. The reason they had a deep playoff run last year was they took advantage of the plethora of injuries in the eastern conference.  They aren’t that good.  They took a step back This year.,1514428296355790861,JORDAN23H,25641157

I know I’m probably in the minority of Braves fan base but I do wish Freddie Freeman was here for the ring ceremony. It’s sad it didn’t work out for him to retire with us. He contributed so much to our team and Helping  us get this championship in 2021.,1512921136677404676,JORDAN23H,25641157
