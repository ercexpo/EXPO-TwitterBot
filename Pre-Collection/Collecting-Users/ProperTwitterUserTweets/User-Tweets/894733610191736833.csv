Love what I saw from Austin Reeves this season. Lakers got another good one. #LakersNation,1513657338971885568,Hornelius760,894733610191736833
Frank Vogal wasn’t the problem. Rob Pelinka is the problem for letting a player dictate personnel moves. @Lakers can’t let LeGM run the team. LeWestbrook experiment was a complete bust.,1513616134007767041,Hornelius760,894733610191736833
What an amazing year. That offense was so exciting to watch. https://t.co/SEKyT37faL,1511561426250305541,Hornelius760,894733610191736833
