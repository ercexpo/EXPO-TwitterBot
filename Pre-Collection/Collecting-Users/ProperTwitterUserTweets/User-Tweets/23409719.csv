"Absolutely adored An American in Paris at the @artscentremelb. Beautiful dancing and singing, beautiful sets, beautiful people. It sets it up by casting Robbie Fairchild, but AAIP is a piece of romantic musical theatre where the male lead is always better than the female lead.",1514587945952759811,glenndunks,23409719
"The David Lynch rumour had literally been debunked by the very person whose tweet had sparked it, so not sure why people still thought it was happening. Still, who’s the American with movies and a popular tv show to their name who made a secret movie that’s premiering at Cannes?",1514580997861703680,glenndunks,23409719

"X wears its inspiration of THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE proudly, but thankfully doesn't attempt to mimic its unreplicable tone. Stretches itself almost a bit too much before it gets to the jolts and gore, but still works a real treat. Not sold on Goth, but Ortega and Snow are !! https://t.co/u9lIUbCbOm",1514202499204280324,glenndunks,23409719

"The future of this country—and the planet—is being manipulated by ego-hungry journos eager for gotcha moments that are getting twisted and contorted into being some litmus test while others (LNP!) just lie, cheat, steal &amp; criminally undermine Australia #AusVotes2022 #auspol https://t.co/B7ncUsTh0e",1514120058145894407,glenndunks,23409719
