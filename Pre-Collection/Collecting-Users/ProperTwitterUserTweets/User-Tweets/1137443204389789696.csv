"More than any other team in these playoffs, Miami seems like a group that’ll benefit hugely from rest.

"BI, CJ, and Zion will, should the latter return to his ‘20-21 form, represent the NBA’s best offensive trio. Put those three on the court with a solid rim-protector and the league’s premier wing defender and look out. Willie has his squad buying in fully. Sky = limit next season.",1514742810955591688,hooperbole,1137443204389789696

"You can’t tell me Lonnie Walker couldn’t be a 20+ PPG scorer if he wanted. His combination of basketball talent, overall fluidity, and effortless athleticism is staggering. He’s a knockdown shooter who can absolutely fly. Sometimes he makes it look so easy.",1514430291661623297,hooperbole,1137443204389789696
