The officials/hosts were late getting the gym open and most of my team didnâ€™t show up so we forfeited. We scrimmaged with two of the opponents on our team. We still lost. I did one of those bits where I make like 10-15 straight shots in warmups then go 1-10 in the game lol,1514386001883504648,themadlineman,35356357
Hope the Giants and Nats play each other in their city connect jerseys,1514225843245101056,themadlineman,35356357
