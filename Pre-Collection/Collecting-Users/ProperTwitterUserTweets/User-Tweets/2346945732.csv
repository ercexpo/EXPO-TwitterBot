Please fire Borrego @hornets,1514388888390971403,jordan_s6996,2346945732
I feel like the fact that the 2018 royals pitching draft class being this bad says more about their player development than anything. No way ALL of those guys should suck this much. After all being highly touted and each of the big 3 were top100 prospects at points.🤢🤢🥴🥴,1514061127742808070,jordan_s6996,2346945732
The royals really watched Santana and Dozier all of last season and said “yeah it’s cool if these 2 are in our every day lineup again next year” lmao,1513588891013550086,jordan_s6996,2346945732
