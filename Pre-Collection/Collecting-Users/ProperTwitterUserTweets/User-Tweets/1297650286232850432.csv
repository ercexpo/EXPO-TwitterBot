"What are some TV shows that you never skip the intro to?

Mine are The Office and Game of Thrones",1514101958424027136,dailyDAWGdose,1297650286232850432
"Hypothetically, If the browns traded Kareem hunt for draft picks, how would #brownstwitter feel about this?",1514101740999790598,dailyDAWGdose,1297650286232850432
"Why do people feel the need to comment some smug BS like “you know nothing about this” when their profile pic is of an anime character, their profile says they’re in high school, and they have like 52 followers. Yeah, ok pal, you sure are the expert here.",1514098409350864900,dailyDAWGdose,1297650286232850432
"Who are some day 2 or 3 targets for the browns?

My favorite currently is LB Jojo Doman.",1514096184499003397,dailyDAWGdose,1297650286232850432
"My reflection on the Cavs loss

Stop running plays for Markanan to shoot 3s, it isn’t working. 

D down the stretch was terrible.

This team just can’t score and their Achilles heel is getting out rebounded. When they lose the glass, AND don’t shoot well, they lose every game.",1514095489733513221,dailyDAWGdose,1297650286232850432

You cannot convince me otherwise.

I’m prepared to die on this hill until he makes changes to his play calling, and game planning.",1513529629373616140,dailyDAWGdose,1297650286232850432
If only our DC knew how to dial up pressure effectively! Myles would have 20+ sacks each year. https://t.co/i49n4ls2I4,1513242587754287106,dailyDAWGdose,1297650286232850432

"Trying to bring up how the Texans losing against winning teams in 2020, despite DW leading the league in passing, them losing being HIS fault, is the single dumbest point you can possibly make.

It’s even dumber if you compare him to baker for that season.

"This is an ideal #mockdraft #browns 

Watson would be an ideal counter part to amari Cooper. 

Pachal 6’3 270 and McCall 6’3 379 would help provide quality depth AND solve our run defense issue up front. 

We pick up a good developmental TE and quality DB depth too https://t.co/NNZrpkUgPQ",1510759741181542411,dailyDAWGdose,1297650286232850432
