"I met MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred back in 2015 at the All-Star Game in Cincinnati. Our friendship reached new heights last month during the lockout so I decided to pen him a letter for @simplyafan18, ‚ÄúDear Rob, Thanks For Listening.‚Äù https://t.co/eIrMXytT5H",1514665717580378112,MarkHJent,3296011954

Dear Rob,

"Since it was Kershaw Day &amp; more important, his season debut - I had a reminder set for today‚Äôs Dodgers-Twins game. Little did I know! I might keep this screenshot to show my grandkids one day to tell them about the greatest 7 inning performance in history. #ClaytonKershaw https://t.co/Iwc7BHuHuX",1514430920530538496,MarkHJent,3296011954
"Great article from @ByMcCullough on Clayton Kershaw‚Äôs 7 perfect innings today in his season debut. Even though I wanted to see him go for it, I‚Äôm more glad that he‚Äôs just healthy on the mound wearing Dodger blue. https://t.co/SI5O7bVwjK",1514427257607143431,MarkHJent,3296011954
"‚Ä¢ He made some errors ‚úîÔ∏è
‚Ä¢ He then made a mistake ‚úîÔ∏è
‚Ä¢ He owned it and apologized ‚úîÔ∏è
‚Ä¢ He gets standing ovation from the Philly faithful ‚úîÔ∏è

Well done Alec Bohm. Well done Philadelphia. Play ball. https://t.co/VTOmC3PgGc",1514403942049931268,MarkHJent,3296011954
"Okay that was awesome. I‚Äôm just going to be scrolling Twitter the rest of today retweeting all the things everyone else types/writes about #ClaytonKershaw near perfect game. Or maybe I just create a big long thread of RTs. Btw I don‚Äôt like the Dave Roberts decision, but I get it.",1514339336610852871,MarkHJent,3296011954
"1/ As Clayton Kershaw takes the mound today, he begins his 15th MLB season. A few items to note: 
‚Ä¢ with 15 seasons, he trails on Don Sutton with most seasons as a Dodger
‚Ä¢ with 2,670 Ks Kershaw only needs 27 to pass Sutton‚Äôs franchise record of 2,696

A few months ago I decided to buy 30 tix to the first @NashvilleSC game at the new stadium. Seeing that nearly all my energy the past four years has gone towards baseball I didn‚Äôt know the response. Yesterday I sent the first promo email to subscribers &amp; it sold out within hours! https://t.co/NUiyL0Paht,1514072026948030468,MarkHJent,3296011954
