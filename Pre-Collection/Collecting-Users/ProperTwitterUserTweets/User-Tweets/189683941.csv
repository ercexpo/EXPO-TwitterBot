"Being in NC, I don't get to see many Hawks games - last night was a fun one to watch. Would've loved to have seen Trae go off but his passing + Nate's game plan were great. Hawks did well enough until Hunter went Baby Kawhi on 'em in the 3rd",1514644339783348224,DJBrohawk,189683941

The Spurs missing a couple baskets might've cost them the game in the last few mins,1514452125866156036,DJBrohawk,189683941

"The Hawks (the team) have been pretty damn good.

Trae's long range shots have almost all been ugly and a poor decision.",1514409660614336516,DJBrohawk,189683941
"My God, the Hawks have turned into the ECF Hawks once again",1514406457449631747,DJBrohawk,189683941
"uh oh, Trae hit a 3",1514401755085393924,DJBrohawk,189683941
Trae's a big game player but he needs to take a deep breath at half time. The passes are exquisite but he's so out of control with his shots. Could come down to whether he or Ball goes off in 2h,1514397504288309252,DJBrohawk,189683941
"Trae's playing out of control right now. Feels like he's constantly going for the highlight play but he's so good, half of them are still converting",1514394158592630788,DJBrohawk,189683941
