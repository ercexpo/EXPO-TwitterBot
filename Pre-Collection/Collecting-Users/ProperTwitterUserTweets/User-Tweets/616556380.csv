"Things might finally be settling down with the ostomy bag, but now the heater in the house is out. Just unbelievable timing.",1514588972818878468,MrWartburg,616556380
"Nothing like a second ER trip in as many weeks, amirite? Very dehydrated, hopefully that's all this is. Bag has been going nuts since yesterday.",1513246250543501317,MrWartburg,616556380
"Been home a few days now, getting used to having a ostomy again (hopefully just for a few months this time). Thankfully I have a lot of black shirts like, @echochlo's, to hide the bag. So how about a short little Tunic stream tonight to get back to normal?

So just before this last Crohn's flare put me in the hospital I had finally bit the bullet and bought a Series X. Shoutout to @BottomShelfJoe for helping me get this thing set up this afternoon! https://t.co/umipG9ifcJ,1511822155645861897,MrWartburg,616556380
"Made it home from the hospital, and took a two hour nap, the only correct thing to do when getting home after 10 days away.",1511502278863331328,MrWartburg,616556380
Just saw the thrd doctor that has said I'm getting out tomorrow. IF I somehow end having to spend anything night in this room I'm gonna lose it. I have a Series X at home that arrived literally two days after my surgery and man do I want to finally play some games on it.,1511084718858584072,MrWartburg,616556380
"Day 8 and there just might be light at the end of the tunnel on this hospital stay. Kidney function is much improved. All we're waiting is for  the intestines to slow down (taking Metamucil and imodium) and then I'm out of here. Hopefully tomorrow, but no set day yet.",1510618982788784134,MrWartburg,616556380
Sitting in a Mayo Clinic hospital bed right now with no clue if I'm having stomach surgery or not. Sounds like the nasal suction tube is staying in overnight and I still have three disconnected IV needles in my arms. Guess I'll have an update tomorrow morning.,1508243488323821580,MrWartburg,616556380
Just might able to get this dice box done before the weekend is over. The burning part at least turned out quite nicely. https://t.co/S5tbmTg2cj,1507922712345333764,MrWartburg,616556380
