Yankees fan are the most spoiled and self-entitled. I am a Yankees fan and there are@times I fall under that category. Got to believe in the plan.,1503460172777275396,DelaneyReal,985977370900230145
Fellow Yankees fans. Just breath. There is a greater plan involved that we are unaware of. Be patient! Good things are still to come.,1503458832491683843,DelaneyReal,985977370900230145

Another SS option off the boards for the Yankees. Is Correa or Story heading to the Yankees?? One can hope! https://t.co/7vo9CE08Gi,1502684082517463045,DelaneyReal,985977370900230145
Looks like Cashman is letting the market come down to his liking. Simmons is off the board as an SS option. Correa and Story are left. One of the two to the Yankees? Let’s hope!,1502663016361467906,DelaneyReal,985977370900230145
As Saturday is here who or if will the Yankees sign? They need help at SS and 1B. Correa and Rizzo perhaps?,1502652637262626823,DelaneyReal,985977370900230145

MLB owners and the MLBPA do not care about the fans and obviously about playing any games. These self entitled owners and players don’t care about the game. Just their checking accounts.,1489698090705690633,DelaneyReal,985977370900230145
