This is one of my favorite and most underrated parts of hockey. The lead pass to the man out of the box for a breakaway. https://t.co/OUGvePfusg,1514749646765236239,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
May there be many more homers in with your new contract B-Rey,1514748566408945672,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
It’s the sixth game of the year and Pirates fans are voicing their displeasure over Castillo not being in the starting lineup (Chavis should too). Bucco baseball is back.,1514734953724100619,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
Sets up talks for a potential long-term extension and continued talks over the next year or so https://t.co/z1GgJljhNx,1514667817450328070,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
Pitt is now rich. What a world we live in. https://t.co/AtJRJPU8aD,1514638250740264960,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
I really like what the Pirates are doing right now. The Hayes deal is obviously fantastic. Signing Reynolds to a two-year deal helps for a potential long-term deal and no hard feelings at arbitration. Cruz and others here soon. Things just seem... different. Still steps to take.,1514637253540208641,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
Now this would be the “stake in the ground” https://t.co/1oyRgm7Mpb,1514633937737375748,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
Good way to begin a Thursday. Good on the Pirates for making this deal happen. Gave Reynolds more money than he requested in arbitration. Hope it lays the groundwork for more. https://t.co/uYSkTOyN2N,1514629076258074630,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
Three pitchers for the Indianapolis Indians combine to no-hit the St. Paul Saints tonight on the road 5-0. Chase De Jong pitched seven hitless innings for the Pirates Triple A affiliate. Austin Brice and Yerry De Los Santos pitched the final two innings in the win @BucsDugout,1514428586001903619,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
"Ke’Bryan Hayes is 4-4 today with an RBI and two runs scored. Hitting .500 on the year. Oh, and he’s a Gold Glove caliber third baseman... signed potentially through 2030.",1514323146324824081,AustinRBechtold,751072863277506560
