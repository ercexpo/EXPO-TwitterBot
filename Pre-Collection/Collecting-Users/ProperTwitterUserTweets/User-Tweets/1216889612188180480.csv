"Don't worry, Aaron. You'll be watching Vlad on TV in the Postseason when the Yankees are eliminated and you're signing your contract with the San Francisco Giants who will massively overpay for you üëç https://t.co/8RAcIpHvFi",1514566167997861890,SavageInYourBox,1216889612188180480

"The Yankees MUST trade Aaron Judge ASAP if he thinks he's anything more than $300M. Francisco Lindor, Gerrit Cole, Manny Machado, and Mookie Betts are all underperforming.

If he wants to be Robinson Cano 2.0 he can go somewhere else. We've seen this movie before once or twice.",1513401705219641345,SavageInYourBox,1216889612188180480
"I'm telling you right now if this is true, Judge lost a fan. There is absolutely no way he is worth $360 Million dollars. He's not the best Right Fielder in baseball. He's not even the best runner up Right Fielder in baseball.

I say let another team overpay for him. https://t.co/Sk3DvxDgUO",1513396924858216449,SavageInYourBox,1216889612188180480
"I can already hear John Sterling's home run call for Brian Reynolds when the Yankees end up trading for him.

""That ball is hit high, it is far, it is gone! A solo home run for Bryan Reynolds. Bryan, leaves em' cryin! And it's a 3 to nothing ballgame.""",1510096679395078145,SavageInYourBox,1216889612188180480

"It's so unfair how the owners of the Oakland Athletics bring down the rest of baseball and their fanbases/teams. How have people not bullied them into selling the team?
