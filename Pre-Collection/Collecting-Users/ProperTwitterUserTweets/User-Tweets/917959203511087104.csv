I don’t understand why Malakai and House of Black are feuding with none other than Fuego Del Sol. The smallest wrestler on the #AEW roster. If there was ever a moment where a wrestler deserves better it’s now. In this very instance #AEWDynamite,1514452952689221632,jayhenry79,917959203511087104
Not a ReDRagon fan but that was a fantastic tag match for the belts against Jurassic Express. I enjoyed that. #AEWDynamite,1514447605362692097,jayhenry79,917959203511087104

Grayson Waller’s arm isn’t injured??? How is that possible? His arm looked absolutely wrecked at Stand And Deliver on that 🪜 spot through another 🪜. Wow #WWENXT,1514060281973932033,jayhenry79,917959203511087104

"It was one year ago I had the unique opportunity of interviewing @Jon_Anik, and still to this day it’s one of the coolest things I’ve ever done.

No Rey vs Veer. No women’s tag team title match between Sasha/Naomi vs Liv/Rhea. No tag team title match between Usos/RKBro. If I were Detroit I’d want my money back. #WWERaw,1513702794380730371,jayhenry79,917959203511087104
That was an easy one to figure out #WWERaw https://t.co/ThQDVBL9q9,1513699314958184448,jayhenry79,917959203511087104
