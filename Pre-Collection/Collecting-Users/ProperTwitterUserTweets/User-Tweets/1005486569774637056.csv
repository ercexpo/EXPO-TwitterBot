"You can’t win every game, but it would have been nice to see a hitting game plan that put the ball on the ground or featured line drives in this wind. #PopUpTheater",1514701038300848129,SoxInTheBasemnt,1005486569774637056
"The @Burgatron13 celebration after catching that pop up produced pure belly laughs, #WhiteSox",1514693997402415108,SoxInTheBasemnt,1005486569774637056
Wonder if Mariners media will blame the wind on the Sox ground crew.,1514689121595310087,SoxInTheBasemnt,1005486569774637056

It’s cool to see former guests @Burgatron13 and @JimmyLambert12 on the field together today in Chicago. Two guys guaranteed nothing coming into the season who have worked hard to play this April game in the show. #LetsGo #WhiteSox https://t.co/3xAYFmAbfE,1514665828096131073,SoxInTheBasemnt,1005486569774637056
One year ago today we saw the Rodon no-hitter. They may have even less people here this time around! #WhiteSox https://t.co/me23Qrz60U,1514663102465384461,SoxInTheBasemnt,1005486569774637056
Can't wait to see this lineup...and they'll probably still win. #WhiteSox https://t.co/1tufsz65ab,1514452088100728835,SoxInTheBasemnt,1005486569774637056
