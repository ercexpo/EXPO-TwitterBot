Ca. We just get @HerbDeanMMA out of the ring? Let’s hope he either stops it when he needs to or doesn’t stop it when he doesn’t need to,1513022376400891905,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
The @WWE really took a dump just now on every member of the #WWEUniverse with that absolutely horrible main event. They really just built @BrockLesnar up to squash him to @WWERomanReigns ? 500 days too many!,1510830260232888324,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
Farewell @WWE after that I am officially @AEW,1510827003448070146,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
How does this bum even still have a contract let alone a #WrestleMania match. @fightbobby kick his …. And there’s no way he’s 400 wwe stop lying,1510779995295293445,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
There is an undeniable difference between the crowds of the @WWE and @AEWonTV and #WrestleMania shows it,1510610107368980483,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
I’ve said it once I’ll say it again. @DominickHits619 doing nothing short of riding @reymysterio mask strings.  @mikethemiz deserves the respect he calls for. #WrestleMania,1510581910464049154,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
I’m so glad to see @WWEUsos keep the title because at least it’s a legitimate tag team keeping the titles at #WrestleMania,1510575805331554305,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
"Ryan is a seriously stupid chef. You are supposed to cater to your guests, not be so sensitive. Like this guy needs to back to whatever crap restaurant he came from. I just want to….smh #BelowDeckDownUnder",1509600491621302274,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
The rich charter guest they have is so annoying. Like the dude is complaining about everything. You can be as rich as you want without being the standard duchebag. #BelowDeckDownUnder,1509596447745921024,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
Captain Jason is a captain I would love to study under. #BelowDeckDownUnder,1509593778998464533,Elvis_Wolfe2020,1226329838
