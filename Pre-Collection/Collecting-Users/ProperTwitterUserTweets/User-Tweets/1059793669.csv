"The Royals need to:
- Move Bobby Witt Jr down the lineup. 
- Move Nicky Lopez up the lineup. 
- Move Carlos Santana out the lineup.",1514820705317101574,Preston__Farr,1059793669
Carlos Santana over his last 242 PA for the #Royals: 38 wRC+.,1514810933977124867,Preston__Farr,1059793669
"Bobby Witt Jr. really struggling versus the slider right now. He needs a huge hit to break out the funk (not surprised by early struggles. It happens). 

He laid off a hanging slider that he should’ve slapped for a hit before swinging at a dirt changeup for the strikeout. https://t.co/itkGEkMQDM",1514798833175171083,Preston__Farr,1059793669
Jake Brentz is somehow so good and so bad at the exact same time. Gotta button up his location to become an elite bullpen option.,1514794426077380608,Preston__Farr,1059793669
"Collin Snider has become an instant high-leverage arm that has been outstanding early this season. 

He got saved by Whit right there but I’m impressed by his arm so far.",1514788636461469701,Preston__Farr,1059793669
"Zack Greinke is severely underrated as a pitcher in the late stages of his career. 

His command, location, and pitch decisions are just outstanding. Rarely misses his spots. #Royals",1514783081370042375,Preston__Farr,1059793669
Triple for Bobby!,1514761256468590606,Preston__Farr,1059793669
I ranked Marsh as my No. 4 #Royals prospect entering the season (yes ahead of Lacy) and for good reason. A full 5-pitch mix with at least 3 plus offerings. 5K through 2 IP tonight. https://t.co/Rxl9YaCftn,1514405006916526080,Preston__Farr,1059793669
"Daniel Lynch has flashed brilliant stuff tonight. Giving up the long balls didn’t help, but about as impressive as a 6-run start can be. 

15 swings and misses. DeGrom led all pitchers in 2021 with a 21.6% swinging strike rate. Lynch so far tonight at 19%. #TogetherRoyal https://t.co/eu92rCWnf0",1514051050478612482,Preston__Farr,1059793669
