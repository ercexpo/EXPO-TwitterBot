This was a weird one for me at the time. https://t.co/JjcFNwKkbp https://t.co/d0FZ18ckxn,1514671969228181506,MNBillsBacker,248920666
$7M for Geno Smith? I'll never understand the backup QB market.,1514670746848612354,MNBillsBacker,248920666
He's been doing this for years. Mike and the Mad Dog would regularly play his calls and just laugh hysterically. https://t.co/5mIMZ0OQQR,1514636636641976325,MNBillsBacker,248920666
"Looking back at it, I really didn't tweet much about the QB class in '18 except for how much I didn't like Darnold. Here's my lone Rosen take. https://t.co/uTWrp4aViG",1514405601694076938,MNBillsBacker,248920666
Rodriguez not throwing strikes with a 5 run lead.,1514337293817061402,MNBillsBacker,248920666
Darnold was the first round QB I really didn't like coming out of that draft. Just never saw elite traits. Obviously I should have seen the same with Rosen lol. https://t.co/XibCQOhlJT,1514322394546159624,MNBillsBacker,248920666
Looked back to see if I had any Allen takes pre-draft that could have been oldtakesexposed material and really didn't. I actually seemed to focus more on how much I didn't want Darnold. And I actually defended 17 a little for how severely he was being hammered on-line. https://t.co/BOUF98KfBa,1514321785533173764,MNBillsBacker,248920666
That's the 9th time a Met has been HBP this year. Crazy.,1514310308143288320,MNBillsBacker,248920666
Here's what I would say about Hall at 25: There's unlikely the be a player there that would make a greater immediate impact than him. Does that make it worth passing on higher value position like CB? That's the question. https://t.co/FsNTHlURoN,1514279218548559891,MNBillsBacker,248920666
"I have a hard time understanding how anyone sees it any other way. Some might be slightly better route runners, others may have slightly better hands, but no one will stress a defense like Williams. https://t.co/isgKddMusB",1513928837448491010,MNBillsBacker,248920666
