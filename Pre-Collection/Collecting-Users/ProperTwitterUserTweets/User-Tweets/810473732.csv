"Grizzlies will struggle with the Timberwolves because they’re one of the few teams that can bother Morant while also defending the 3-point line at a high level. If KAT dominates, it could be a war, but I’ll stick with the Grizzlies just being a more consistent team. Memphis in 6.",1514100088112615424,Giavotella_170,810473732
This game just proves talent and athleticism can win out even under bizarre circumstances. Clippers played as good as they’re capable of playing in this situation and they’re on their way to a do or die playoff game on Friday night in LA.,1514097097397747712,Giavotella_170,810473732
D’Angelo Russell is one the most slept on players in the NBA with real NBA talent. He’s a bucket and always seems to enjoy pressure packed moments and games.,1514096027363680260,Giavotella_170,810473732
"It’s Anthony Edwards team now, not KAT’s",1514095457601003520,Giavotella_170,810473732
If Towns wasn’t fouling every other minute his team would be well in their way to clinching the seventh seed.,1514091628574687232,Giavotella_170,810473732
Karl-Anthony Towns was horrible tonight. Can’t be compared with the other elite bigs coming up this small in a game of this importance.,1514091191658237954,Giavotella_170,810473732
"I’m not sure next week’s season finale can clean up what they did in this ninth episode. Sometimes slow pace is the best pace, writers were in a hurry to try to wrap up plot points or push them to the point where they take a turn towards another. #PowerForce #PowerBookIV",1513061571399929863,Giavotella_170,810473732
"I seriously hated this episode like wtf was this …. They had a good thing going for a few weeks now and then worked hard to make Claudia, Jenard and Vic all look like idiots. #PowerForce  #PowerBookIV",1513059397118959620,Giavotella_170,810473732
This episode was like someone forcing down as many fruits as possible in a blender but never starting it up to make the drink #PowerForce  #PowerBookIV,1513058026827264001,Giavotella_170,810473732
