Best part of that Seattle Mariners 5-1 win is that it was all the young players making huge contributions.  Jarred Kelenic hits a two-run bomb.  Cal Raleigh hits a solo shot.  And Logan Gilbert only allows 1 run (should have been zero without the crazy wind).  #SeaUsRise,1514714310164971537,Jome253,90329934
"OK, MITCH!!! You made up for your bad play earlier.  Two-Run bomb in the 8th inning.  Absolutely crushed it! #SeaUsRise",1514702972327923730,Jome253,90329934
Mitch Haniger was like “This was supposed to be an out so let me just stupidly try to go for a double and get out.”  #SeaUsRise,1514691873062862850,Jome253,90329934
This wind is an absolute nightmare for the Mariners right now.  Two routine in-field pop-ups lead to a double and a single and the White Sox are on the board.  What a joke.  #SeaUsRise,1514689520280637445,Jome253,90329934

"I was hoping like hell @Windham6 would show up at WrestleMania this year.  I miss Bray’s creative mind for the business and excellent character work.  If he wants to be back in WWE or AEW, I hope it happens for him. https://t.co/zkIBFDbSl2",1513366595275395074,Jome253,90329934
