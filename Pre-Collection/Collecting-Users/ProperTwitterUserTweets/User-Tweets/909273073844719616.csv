"Wow, this is so unexpected!  I would like to thank my Mom and Dad, @pwmsoxfan, my kids, my office staff, &amp; the families in my practice.  A special thanks to a sweet ray of sunshine patient for bestowing this tremendous honor on me (along with a sticker from @WaltDisneyWorld). https://t.co/xLmfyDwSzL",1507480260027236354,DrDubail,909273073844719616

Thank you to Evan Johnston from @chelliepingree office for meeting with the Maine Delegation of the #AAPAdvocacy conference 2022 to talk about Pediatric Mental Health.  @MaineAAP @legere_ben20,1506387422522884099,DrDubail,909273073844719616
I appreciated connecting with Maria Olson from @SenatorCollins office as the Maine Delegation with @legere_ben20 at the 2022 #AAPAdvocacy conference.  We learned about how the bills we were seeking co-sponsorship for on child mental health become part of bigger spending packages. https://t.co/vELmAFIPBS,1506386705389084675,DrDubail,909273073844719616
