Gore was the 1st jersey I ever purchased with my own money many moons ago. I'm so happy and proud to have seen him play in person several times and that he'll be a 49er for life! Congrats on an illustrious career @frankgore! See you in Canton! #FTTB #49ers https://t.co/do9hK0Uwj8,1511057865616011264,turtle_hannah,2872664290
