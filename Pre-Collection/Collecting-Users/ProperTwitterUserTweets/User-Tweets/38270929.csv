"The 5th Dimension's cover of ""Age of Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In"" from HAIR is an all-timer. If we're going more obscure, I love Gillian Welch's version of Radiohead's ""Black Star."" https://t.co/obuEygszX2",1514698356399902740,FilmIntuition,38270929

"Recently revisited WINGS OF DESIRE for the 1st time in years &amp; have not stopped thinking about it since.
