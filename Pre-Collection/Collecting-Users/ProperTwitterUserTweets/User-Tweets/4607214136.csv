"4/14 MLB Play #3

0.5u - Phillies / Marlins F5 u4.5 (-130)
0.5u - Phillies / Marlins NRFI (-130)

- Alcantara vs Gibson. Gibson struck out 10 in his first outing of the season and looked good. Low total ands ballpark that favors pitchers.

0.5u- Mariners F5 ML (-120)
0.5u- Mariners ML (-110)

- Gilbert is the much better SP in this matchup. Lambert is a AAA arm that struggled last season. SEA’s bullpen looks to be a solid unit &amp; CWS pen is tired. I like SEA to take a game here.
