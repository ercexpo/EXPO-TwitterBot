How many @Braves fans will see this?! Comment or like this if you are please.,1513508592795672579,milhousebb,215821042
I hope @obj stays out of Cleveland! He had his shot and didn't get everything he wanted and then cried like a little child until they released him. STAY AWAY OBJ!,1507135013174886405,milhousebb,215821042
It's sad to see that apparently the @Braves did @FreddieFreeman5 dirty like they did...but in the end it's a business also. Good luck in LA @FreddieFreeman5 !! https://t.co/aQzCeOovnG,1505171599166685191,milhousebb,215821042
Never thought he would leave Atlanta. I have nothing negative to say about him or his decision. He's truly a class act. https://t.co/kihj6teRcx,1504930507255128067,milhousebb,215821042
Hey @Reds why are you trading away the entire team yet again?! Please send Joey Votto to a team that wants to win he deserves it he doesn't deserve to waste another season!,1504179831990374400,milhousebb,215821042
If the @Browns let @bakermayfield go just to get a scumbag @deshaunwatson I give up on that team and that's my home team but I can't take anymore of their insanity! I will be a @Titans fan 100%!!,1504141712477802505,milhousebb,215821042
Hey @zack_hample who's gonna sign @FreddieFreeman5 ?!,1503755582783766530,milhousebb,215821042
Come on @RedSox sign @FreddieFreeman5 he would be such an amazing addition to the Sox and he would do amazing things in @fenwaypark !!,1503743245175693314,milhousebb,215821042
All I can say is WOW can this administration be farther outta their minds?! This is a complete and total joke and I look forward to a better administration in a couple years! #LetsGoBrandon,1498419903061233671,milhousebb,215821042
