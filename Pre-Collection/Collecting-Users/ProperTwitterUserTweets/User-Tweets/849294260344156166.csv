"Character crawl video #3 features Michael Morbius, aka the Living Vampire. DON'T go see the trash movie--but check out my 3-minute on him--it's much better.

Sony after watching Marvel Studios make a ton of successful movies starting Spider-Man characters. https://t.co/QG2E760q2g,1509724076847288324,spideylibrarian,849294260344156166
Seeing the Morbius film is like walking in on your grandparent naked: some things just can't be unseen. https://t.co/mltYVqNcXP,1509723021971542018,spideylibrarian,849294260344156166
"Character crawl video #2 features Miles Morales. It's exactly 3 minutes long, and part of a continuing series I'm working on. Enjoy!

"Sony does not know what to do with Spider-Man or his characters. Sam Raimi knows, Lord and Miller know, Marvel Studios knows. Sony? Not so much. https://t.co/h9zJ2rCWR9",1507440098236841991,spideylibrarian,849294260344156166
"NGL, I'm ambivalent towards this announcement. Sony has at best a shaky track record with demonstrating how much they know about Spidey and his web of characters. Morbius isn't looking good, and I don't believe they'll do any better with a relatively obscure Madame Web. https://t.co/AYLD4c84I0",1507426936125014035,spideylibrarian,849294260344156166
"Finally!

While I consider Tom the best overall Spidey and enjoy the MCU Spidey films the most, Tobey brought greatness to the first live-action movies. I love those films, and am thankful Sam Raimi made them.

So, yeah. I'm happy Tobey's Spidey finally got his own NWH poster. https://t.co/7ydkpRvZ1W",1506733123958198278,spideylibrarian,849294260344156166
That @Wendys spicy chicken sandwich isn't fooling around. I could barely finish it. It's got as much fire as its Twitter account.,1506351403249324037,spideylibrarian,849294260344156166
"Am I still uploading to YouTube? Yes.

Am I still struggling to balance it with life? Yes.

Do I wish I were better at capturing and retaining attention? Gods, Yes.

Am I going to keep on keeping on? Yes.

Will I continue to celebrate with posts like this?

Yes.
