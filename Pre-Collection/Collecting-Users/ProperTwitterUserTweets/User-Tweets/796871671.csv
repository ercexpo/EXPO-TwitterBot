"A little more progress on this guy, added some subtle detail to the muscles. Head and feet are obviously placeholder :) The concept is not mine, it's made by a super talented artist named Nesskain - his portfolio is https://t.co/Wz0KhhSxzt

"lol i got a new hard drive and fresh installed OS and all my software and setting up Maya I couldn't find the entry to set a hotkey for transform constraints. Duck-duck-go-d it and the top result is me answering someone else asking this on a forum 2 years ago. Thanks, past me!",1507925323194716163,JarienSky,796871671
"Im a Batman fan but so sick of the Joker. His character isnt interesting to me. Hes just a troll. You cant reason with foes whose only agenda or motivation is causing chaos. Its hard for Bat to swallow bc antithetical to his logic but once he learns, Joker stops being interesting",1507503918967922695,JarienSky,796871671
"I quickly sketched and inked #Batgirl while I was on a bumpy train, so I'm pretty happy with this even though the line quality is shaky. Trying to work on  expressive and natural poses and faces. #superhero #sketch https://t.co/bOqyZhVErD",1507167568603271173,JarienSky,796871671
"More life drawing, getting back in the swing of it! Poses range from 5 to 30 minutes. I'm actually pretty happy with these! H and 2B graphite on Canson 65lb sketch paper.

"I sketched Batman and I'm actually pretty happy with how he turned out! Rough so far but I think I'll clean it up and color it. I liked in the last few issues of the comic he wore the bat emblem in a yellow oval again!

I agree w this advice on principle but in reality it's not always feasible. Some institutions have strict rules about pay when hiring contractors. If you can't work within that ruleset it's easier for them to find someone else than to change their rules. Still worth reading tho! https://t.co/yqft3H8LsR,1505766807738716164,JarienSky,796871671
"Very work-in-progress 3D sculpt. Everything starts somewhere! Today was working on the hands. This is based on someone else's concept but I'm going to wait til I'm farther along before showing it, still kind of a blockout at this stage.
