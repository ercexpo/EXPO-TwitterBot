"Most important thing: 

- Kershaw looked great during spring training and he looks great to start the reg season. 

- 7 IP, 0 ER, 13 K, 20 whiffs! 

- Dude didn't pick up a ball until Jan. The man's competitive drive knows no equal. #Dodgers

This feels like when Kobe scored 62 through three quarters against the Mavs and didn't play the fourth. #Dodgers,1514324763493031942,DMAC_LA,3004300880
"6 outs away from pitching the 24th perfect game in MLB history. 

You've got to let Kershaw go out there and take it one batter at a time. If he gets some quick outs you HAVE to make a run at history. 

Kersh and Doc must be on the same page on this. They Must be. #Dodgers",1514324569980477440,DMAC_LA,3004300880
