"Slightly fair, but 0% of sports teams exist without fans so also the sentiment here isnâ€™t accurate ðŸ˜Š https://t.co/QqYA8hMw7f",1514664420630269954,Rev_Ev7,476448836
"I think if they had lost in 7 games in a back and forth series, you could make this argumentâ€¦but blowing a 3-1 lead probably makes this futile. https://t.co/3yZXI6gNXE",1514663506313986050,Rev_Ev7,476448836
"If the Hornets and Borrego part ways, I think itâ€™ll be a bad decision. JB isnâ€™t perfect, but I canâ€™t think of a better coach out there who would realistically take the job.",1514600197975814159,Rev_Ev7,476448836
This is devastating. https://t.co/TRle339kkl,1514409259513036812,Rev_Ev7,476448836
"I love the Hornets, but the Hawks are just deeper, more experienced, and just as talented. This is tough.

In a 7 game series, with some opportunity at home, weâ€™d probably have a shot, but a one-game-elimination in Atlanta might be unrealistic to expect a win.",1514402128705593346,Rev_Ev7,476448836
"Friendly reminder for Hornets fans; thereâ€™s no shame in losing to this Hawks team. Theyâ€™re incredibly good, and it was always going to be a tall task to beat them in Atlanta. Proud of how hard the guys have played so far.",1514396894402912256,Rev_Ev7,476448836
"I love Miles so so much, and my heart says yes, but my head says this is just a lot https://t.co/soS7FKZTws",1514329021319942148,Rev_Ev7,476448836

"Making fun of the T-Wolves for being super happy about winning last night is silly and unnecessarily mean. That franchise has been historically worse than my Hornets, which is saying something.

They beat a competent opponent in a win-or-go-home game they deserve to be excited.",1514233776041246729,Rev_Ev7,476448836
Have to figure out how to watch my Hornets AND the Ultimatum tonight,1514233297433415682,Rev_Ev7,476448836
