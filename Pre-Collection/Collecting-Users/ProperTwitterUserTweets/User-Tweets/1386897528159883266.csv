"One thing I really like about Breaking Bad is that it has a lot of really long scenes that are just conversations between two people. So few shows nowadays take the time to do that, but nothing helps enrich a show’s characters more.",1514647924755640336,WBaxterWhite,1386897528159883266
"Tom Brady is undeniably the GOAT, but we should acknowledge that in addition to his unparalleled talent he's also been incredibly lucky. Almost every Super Bowl run of his has featured an important play or sequence that always broke his way.",1514632297584242709,WBaxterWhite,1386897528159883266
"It’s so funny to me how much people try to over-analyze Dark Knight Rises.

Is it a fun superhero movie with some well-placed, Dickens-inspired social commentary? Yes.

Is it a condemnation of Occupy and a warning against radical left-wing terrorism? No. Just ask Nolan!",1514453948895313923,WBaxterWhite,1386897528159883266

I find it fascinating that the play-in games are statistically nonexistent. They don’t count as regular season games or playoff games. Just sort of phantom events for which there’s zero long-term record,1514261413870686209,WBaxterWhite,1386897528159883266
"Idk, 5/20 turned out to be pretty decent starters. 25% isn’t great but it’s not “almost no chance” either https://t.co/z1O9IyN4C8",1513585797487804424,WBaxterWhite,1386897528159883266

Weirdest part of Breaking Bad so far is that my dad is also named W. H. White AND his handwriting/signature is very similar to Walt's in the show,1513548088916422662,WBaxterWhite,1386897528159883266
I didn’t get to see Batman in IMAX so I have now made it my life’s mission to see Doctor Strange in IMAX,1513343791066976256,WBaxterWhite,1386897528159883266
