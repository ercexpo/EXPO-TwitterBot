This movie‚Äôs just been one üö© after the other https://t.co/YzjGBTTrlS,1514696479348244488,ConnorMovies,3391276402

Barbie and Oppenheimer about to have the greatest casts of all time https://t.co/IZ9NYTJxB7,1514643659806937098,ConnorMovies,3391276402
Looks like I‚Äôm very much a fan of Showgirls. It‚Äôs hard not to find enjoyment in it whether you look at it as ‚Äúso bad it‚Äôs good‚Äù or a satire on America &amp; Vegas. Something that happens near the end takes a lot of the fun away but it‚Äôs still another misunderstood gem from Verhoeven https://t.co/8NZ27Z9gih https://t.co/vxsrly7UmJ,1514607924466790412,ConnorMovies,3391276402

This really is JLo‚Äôs year https://t.co/UYfRiJK2Ph,1514284378070958092,ConnorMovies,3391276402
#FatherStu is a formulaic biopic that isn‚Äôt very well put together &amp; rushes through a lot of crucial plot points but Mark Wahlberg‚Äôs committed lead performance &amp; its inspirational true story keep it fairly watchable. It‚Äôs decent but this story deserved a lot better execution https://t.co/sMzZdxok3u,1514260817151201285,ConnorMovies,3391276402
