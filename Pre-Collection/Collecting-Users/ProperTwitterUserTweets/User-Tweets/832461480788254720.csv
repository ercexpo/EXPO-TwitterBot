"People can take shots at Dave Roberts for pulling Clayton Kershaw with a perfect game through 7 innings, 80 pitches, but ultimately that falls on Kershaw. Kershaw is a Hall of Famer and can tell his manager whether he wants to stay in or not. He has that level of respect.",1514324060552904705,fp_jr,832461480788254720
Absolutely shocked that Kershaw didn’t go for the perfect game. Pulled just after 80 Pitches through 7 innings. Great points made here by Jeff. https://t.co/qDpeT8iACd,1514322147446951937,fp_jr,832461480788254720
"Kershaw is perfect through 7.0 IP, 80 Pitches, 13 K and it appears he’s been taken out of the game https://t.co/ey6pQdwIdr",1514320236954095619,fp_jr,832461480788254720
Proud Senior’s take here on Dubon’s bunt up by 9 in the 6th (and him learning how to thread a video on Twitter). Senior and I have had numerous talks evolve over the years about the unwritten rules of the game and the game today. https://t.co/PtEU4N6Efi,1514301558858543107,fp_jr,832461480788254720
"More understanding, teaching, and loving one another rather than throwing someone away and cancelling each other. Love this. I hope something very positive comes of all this. https://t.co/fcA0kggY8N",1514291525030608897,fp_jr,832461480788254720
"Loved Kapler defending Dubon. I understand the old school aspect of bunting for a hit while ahead by a lot, but I also understand the logic of really getting into a bullpen and winning a series. At the end of the day, If you don’t like it, play better. #SFGiants #SFGameUp",1514118023447134209,fp_jr,832461480788254720
