"If you are an @nationals fan may I recommend giving @TJ_White2021 a follow? Exciting, likable switch hitting  OF. Definitely one of the up and comers in the #Nats org. Here's a fun article that @dougherty_jesse wrote about him: https://t.co/11iRLrPcza",1514067352110968839,fam_Denn,1892506526
"Jeremy De La Rosa also hit an absolute bomb tonight to RF, up and out of the ballpark entirely.",1514043776955826183,fam_Denn,1892506526

Only the start  of #BradyHouse's 2nd series of A- ball but these stats are a solid start. https://t.co/F4dSkf0qtY,1514020871945478144,fam_Denn,1892506526
