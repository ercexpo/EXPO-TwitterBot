You think it’s real that @Yankees Severino who throws 96-101 mph really throws this many off speed pitches? In the 6th inning he threw 6 fastball in 16 fastballs,1514782261832347648,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
"You want to talk about being mentally tough, @Angels Shohei Ohtani is thinking about his hitting so much that when he K’s to start the game he now has to go pitch and try to wipe the thought that all hitters can’t erase, and be a pitcher only. Very tough. Most of us can’t do 1",1514775349128695811,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
I hate give away days in @MLB,1514703614459088898,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
"I hate when teams give away games in April just to have to fight late September! I also wish more players were like Jose Abreu, the only guy to my knowledge who won’t come out or take games off. Including spring training. No wonder he is so good! Rare leader in @mlb TY Jose!!",1514700820574474247,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
"So the @Orioles let their hitting coach go after last season and proceed to hire their AA coach to replace him. Bowie had the most loaded roster in the minors last year and had success because of it, not their hitting coach. Experience is vital to teaching/coaching not a computer",1514696258975272981,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
The game in @whitesox shows you why a reliant on analytics can’t always happen.  You have to adjust based on weather like this and how’s the opposing pitcher is pitching. Sox have yet to adjust to human element and weather. Analytics can’t help with that,1514689021791801350,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
I’ve never seen @rays pitcher Tommy Romero pitch before but he is my knee favorite  pitcher. Have y’all seen his minor league numbers. Learning to win in the minors is very important #mlb,1514010978727342082,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
Imagine if Derek Jeter would have said what Alec Bohm said about @Yankees fans? He would have been ran out every year.  Thick skin is a must at the @mlb level y’all. Fans talk shit. It’s fun and it’s all good.,1513887918099767311,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
OMG. We knew this would happen but wow.  @vsin https://t.co/9NZZWuDdZO,1513736714056990721,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
After seeing the slide in the @rangers game I apologize. That was a horrible call and now baseball is as soft as everything else in life.  @mlb you are ruining our game with this dumb shit! We are men playing like men. Leave soft people to do soft people stuff.  Not pro sports!,1513718509829644291,nodontjosh,979828348456087552
