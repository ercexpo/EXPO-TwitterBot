The strike zone on Julio Rodriguez is ridiculous and Tim’s about time Scott Servais made it known. #Mariners,1514716003468410900,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
"Why is it that #Mariner prospects struggle so much when they come to the big leagues? I don’t get it. Can’t be the age. It’s obviously early, but Julio, Jarred, and Cal all look lost at the plate right now.",1514441306398810113,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
"Man, the wave of the future for the #Mariners in Kelenic, Rodriguez, and Raleigh have all been abysmal. They all look lost right now, and it’s a bit disconcerting.",1514436438972010496,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
"Sigh…why? I mean seriously, why can’t the #Mariners have nice things? The hype around the off-season, the hype around JK and Julio, the hype around this season, Goddamnit I’m tired of this!",1514425201102008320,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
Every time Julio and Jarred come to the plate my heart is in my throat. I just want them to succeed so badly. It’s hard to watch them struggle.,1514419313934884864,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
When the hell is it the #Mariners chance to have some luck? Nothing but terrible luck to start this season.,1514417604097572865,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
What the hell did Jesse Winker do to deserve this? Damn. #Mariners,1514417132603289601,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
"The #Mariners bats have been atrocious to start this young season, but my goodness they have hit some terrible luck with this weather.",1514412685282054147,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
"This #Mariners lineup is already infuriating. They can’t string together a good inning to save their lives. They’ve yet to do so in 5 games this season. I get that it’s early, but this has to change and quickly.",1514009480006012930,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
Boy the #Mariners have had some terrible luck…,1513994803385552897,RyanEhrmantrout,814910226113540096
