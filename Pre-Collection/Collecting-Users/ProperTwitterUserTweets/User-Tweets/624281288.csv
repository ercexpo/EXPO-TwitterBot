"I’m sorry but, did u just say trade our best RB and keep Hunt? Hb they trade hunt away. Chubb has been the reason we have won games. He is the one in the game in the 4th quarters. He has been our best offensive player and is a better person. He should be a brown for his career https://t.co/gHB8huGuik",1514791607299575814,christopherlyn6,624281288

Personally every single team should evaluate every single position on the roster and look for an upgrade if it’s better. I’m sure baker was told some truth and some fibs. At the end of the day he didn’t play like a #1 pick every year. He hurt the team last year. https://t.co/Un3bXSoUHM,1514782485002956802,christopherlyn6,624281288
"Miles bridges was given his first technical for approaching the ref aggressively with a clenched fist. I’m sorry but, that’s ridiculous! The second was because he used profanity towards the ref. I 100% believe these refs use profanity towards the players. First tech is a no call",1514496224354832385,christopherlyn6,624281288

Worst offensive foul call I have ever seen called. Brandon Ingram was being fouled not the other way around wow. Just terrible call by the refs,1514430193057808387,christopherlyn6,624281288
Things to note here. 2 out of the 3 guys on this list are buckeyes!! Another note is that 2 out of those 3 were late round picks. Another is that all 3 are big ten guys. Another is that only 1 of the 3 was a first round pick. https://t.co/HiyXum8USm,1514424291508502528,christopherlyn6,624281288
