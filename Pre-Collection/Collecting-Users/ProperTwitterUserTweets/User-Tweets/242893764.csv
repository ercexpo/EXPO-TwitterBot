"I’m a pretty forgiving person, but not being able to re-sign Devers would realllllly be pushing the limits of what I’m willing to accept from a big market team.

Nirvana’s version of “The Man Who Sold The World” is probably my all time favorite. But special shoutout to the @RustonKelly renditions of “Dammit” and “All Too Well” which have been in regular rotation for me recently. https://t.co/aaflD3xYwp,1514635103430844420,BrianMarsters,242893764
Not as big of a spot obviously but I think this is funnier than the one from the Wild Card game https://t.co/MytOShFVxb,1514426820405313537,BrianMarsters,242893764
