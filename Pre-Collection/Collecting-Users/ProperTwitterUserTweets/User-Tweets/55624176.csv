With NBA playoffs starting I’m feeling some hoops love more than normal. Who is your favorite NBA player who never made an all star team?,1514634892545441801,hschmalz,55624176
"I want to do a fantasy league where instead of acquiring players you pick teams. End of season record accounts for 80% of scoring, success in post season 20%. You lose points if you fire a coach or GM during season. All NFL teams must be drafted. Who’s in?",1511849532597760009,hschmalz,55624176
"Just gave up Javonte, Connor, Tannehill and late 23 1st for Dalvin, Akers, Tua and 23 2nd in a superflex dynasty league. Thoughts? @TylerFFCreator @DynastyNerds",1508545184212013059,hschmalz,55624176

Watching a 41 year old man go through 3 rounds of grind makes me feel very out of shape. #UFCFightnight #MattBrown,1507888281643470851,hschmalz,55624176
"First hack at a dynasty league. Also have Baker, Trubisky, 22 1.07 and 2 23 1st. Thoughts on how it looks so far? https://t.co/O374HzyWG2",1507474317184946184,hschmalz,55624176
"I think fair expectations for current pass catchers:
Hardman 600-800 yds
JuJu 800-1000 yds
Kelce 1200 yds
Would leave 2k yds from depth or guys not on roster yet to make mahomes a 5k guy. 1k from RBs, Gordon and others is likely. Need to find around 1k worth of production though",1507046767929352192,hschmalz,55624176
When will we learn that giving people more money from the government will only cause more inflation? If they want to help California citizens cut taxes by 1% for all tax brackets and cut back on government spending https://t.co/G6A2RghMBF,1506993791714045953,hschmalz,55624176
"Don’t understand the complete breakdown from every chiefs fan. If we trust Ried and believe Mahomes is the best QB they will make it work. We get younger and cheaper. It sucks losing Hill, but in reality this isn’t the end of the dynasty, it gives it new life.",1506770696822657025,hschmalz,55624176
So shook. Don’t even know what to think.,1506671328064991236,hschmalz,55624176
