Now Spinning - Genesis 'The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway' (1974). Genesis had many outstanding albums throughout their career...with &amp; without Gabriel...this one is their definitive masterpiece. #Genesis #progrock #prog #vinylrecords #vinylcollection #vinylcommunity #vinyl https://t.co/qzTNgsjuQm,1513955251505799179,cldoyle63,2358615791
Now Spinning - Peter Gabriel 'Peter Gabriel (aka: Security)' (Recorded 1981-82; released 1982). Sounded years ahead if its time in 1982...sounds years ahead of its time in 2022. Perfection! #PeterGabriel #NewWorld #vinylrecords #vinylcommunity #vinylcollector #NowPlaying #vinyl https://t.co/g6RDWkQRtv,1513621165046210569,cldoyle63,2358615791
"Now Spinning - Porcupine Tree 'Signify' (Recorded 1995-96; released 1996). As far as I'm concerned, the album that crowned PT as the best modern day Prog band. Steven's songwriting &amp; guitar work front &amp; center. #PorcupineTree #progrock #vinylrecords #vinylcollection #vinyl https://t.co/EUKzTuaBaZ",1513601754184699910,cldoyle63,2358615791
