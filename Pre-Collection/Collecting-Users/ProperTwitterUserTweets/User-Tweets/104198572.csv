Finally came to the party and watched both seasons of Ted Lasso! I Have to admit every minute was awesome and these are the types of Comedy and Heart shows we need to see more of on our streaming platforms! Let's hope season 3 is not the shows last!!!,1514665125411758080,ChiefsInsider,104198572
"If Melvin Ingram signs with #Dolphins for more money than the #Chiefs were willing to pay, so be it!  Veach isn't going to focus on over 30 guys unless its necessary, so far it's not. Hope he returns, but if he doesn't Veach will find another, or perhaps already has one in mind!",1513943972632276992,ChiefsInsider,104198572
So proud of you Trevor!!! Awesome Job!!! https://t.co/rXE1C35S0b,1513931174443470851,ChiefsInsider,104198572
Royals bullpen is very poorly constructed or coached. Power arms that can’t get outs is not good. Oh well!,1513625959630614530,ChiefsInsider,104198572
He’s not where he’s suppose to be if he wants to take the next step. I just don’t get it. Why repeat the mistakes of a year ago? https://t.co/ch13BTozsE,1513607653179764750,ChiefsInsider,104198572
"Veach is building a WR group, that'll be a collection of 4  capable WR's plus Kelce on the field, similar to the Bengals unit. That success will cause nightmares for opponents with Mahomes on the field. Thus I think Veach drafts 2 WR's with top six picks.",1513549298817974275,ChiefsInsider,104198572
"Tiger Woods deserves a Green Jacket for just showing up to play The Masters.  As reality set in yesterday, that he would be a non factor in the final round today, his herculean effort to play golf again will rank as one of the greatest comebacks of all time! Mad Respect!!!",1513158640559181827,ChiefsInsider,104198572
Amen! My son is in the Air Force!!! https://t.co/fu0X214asH,1512488613015130125,ChiefsInsider,104198572
"I get the love for the Honey Badger, but let's be honest if you read the entire article, he was more concerned with a contract extension, than playing great to give Veach no choice but to sign him. Instead, by his own admission, he didn't give 100%. That's why the Chiefs passed!",1512444698224431106,ChiefsInsider,104198572
He'd be a great fit for #Chiefs! https://t.co/anQOk6GOuU,1512440200579923973,ChiefsInsider,104198572
