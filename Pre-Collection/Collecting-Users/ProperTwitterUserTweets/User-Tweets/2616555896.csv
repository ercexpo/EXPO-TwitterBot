"While my mind is on the #Ravens this morning… I’ve decided they’re the super duper ultra sneaky team that might take a QB in this draft.

"Here’s your weird #NFLDraft stat of the day: 

The #Ravens have FIVE picks in the 4th round. No. 110 (from Giants), 119, 128 (from Cardinals), 139, and 141.

"The #Titans exorbitant 2022 cap hit of $38.6M for Tannehill this season is a result them them being in-between a rock and a hard place:

- They restructured his deal in 2021 to fit Julio onto the roster.

- They don’t want to restructure again and lose their easy out in 2023. https://t.co/T0cUpLJCRZ",1514312442469564416,eastonfreeze,2616555896

Desmond Ridder -110 to go in the 1st round feels like free money to me.,1514256053642354691,eastonfreeze,2616555896

"The @PFF draft simulator just LOVES to push Cordale Flott, CB LSU on the #Titans mid-draft selections. It constantly is trying to get him off the board.",1514252747687747584,eastonfreeze,2616555896
