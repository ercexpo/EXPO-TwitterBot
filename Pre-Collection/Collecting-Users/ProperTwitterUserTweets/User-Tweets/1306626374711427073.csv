"If we’re not gonna have that Heather Derek love, I don’t want it! https://t.co/Cgu3uD3fHo",1514434501308428290,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
Anyone else notice how Derek Carr didn’t mention Josh Jacobs in his list of names of guys needing extensions? 👀,1514427832276987905,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
"Smart move by Derek, and the #raiders, to keep the salary at $24.9M in ‘22. Flexibility. Also, no state tax in Nevada. Could have likely lost up to $5M with a $30M salary to state and local taxes, housing, etc. #thenumbersgame #taxgame",1514301210429325313,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
"(1/2) Also quick shoutout to Mark Davis of the @raiders. His vision to play in a beautiful stadium and give his players the best training facilities! Raiders in Oakland were bottom 5 in yearly revenue. With the new facilities in #vegas, top 5 in #nfl revenue this past season.",1514275503892361220,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
Love the no-trade clause in Derek’s deal. The #raiders have committed to their future. Derek does a lot here in Vegas and has done a lot for the @raiders Good for him and the family to know that they’ll stick around for a while and build their foundation here! #RaiderNation,1514272377038786561,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
"As a fan, I’d like to see the #raiders  also show @derekcarrqb a commitment with tools to get the job done. Adams is 🔒, Waller has 2 yrs left. Renfrow going into the last year of his deal. Should @raiders lock Renfrow in this off-season or wait? #raidernation",1514270514604245002,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
"Congrats to @derekcarrqb That’s my QB! Great deal for both sides. With the cap likely to increase, #raiders will still have flexibility to maneuver and make other solid deals and build the roster. Continuity is key in Vegas. He deserves it! #raidernation",1514267902030999553,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
Imagine the @raiders playing in this sandstorm in an open stadium on a Monday Night! #raiders @RNR920AM,1513654319391797252,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
#raiders catching strays from @ColinCowherd but The Herd is absolutely correct and great use of @raiders to make the comparison. @JoyTaylorTalks #lakers https://t.co/7vVH792xLD,1513627477200965633,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
Never thought I’d see water for $20. “Never Opened” 😅 #RaiderNation #raiders https://t.co/RJRqPeg4Fp,1513396017172934656,alaninvegas,1306626374711427073
