Starting to think this Phillies team is a fraud just like the last few years. They seem to get up and get excited for the opening series and then lose interest. Nothing looks like an upgrade from previous seasons.,1514766211946409992,GalloSays17,198952833
Currently playing against some random in @MLBTheShow and heâ€™s got Chase Utley in a Braves uniform https://t.co/hg0Y6raMvH,1514414586350473220,GalloSays17,198952833
Didnâ€™t get the win today at the @phillies game today but it felt great to be back at my favorite place and our girls had a blast.,1514410421205319689,GalloSays17,198952833
This team isnâ€™t going anywhere with this Aaron Nola,1514310266896400394,GalloSays17,198952833
Rubber match against the other teams ace and Big Game Nola shows up once again. What a fraud,1514309113198661641,GalloSays17,198952833
Overexposing Johan Comargo? Couldnâ€™t be my manager.,1514260104169857030,GalloSays17,198952833

I donâ€™t get this. Baseball is played in a series. Score as much as you can and crush their bullpen so it makes the next game even tougher for them. Why is this so hard to understand? https://t.co/D5NtcUVB19,1514236569347137536,GalloSays17,198952833
