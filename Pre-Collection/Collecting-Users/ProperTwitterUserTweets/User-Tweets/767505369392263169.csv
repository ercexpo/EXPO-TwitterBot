"Sports Media Hates Houston Teams, they rather talk about Any other city sports team. https://t.co/vxwO8bv42c",1513924101458518020,AJ_HOU,767505369392263169
It’s an everyday thing for Astros fans. 🤷🏻‍♂️ oh well see y’all at the World Series. #LevelUp https://t.co/RiU7HOPGOG,1513922117813018626,AJ_HOU,767505369392263169
I feel like no matter how many players step up to say everyone was or has or might still be cheating the Astros were made the poster boys. League knows it that’s why no suspensions were handed out. But people think everyone who puts on an Astros jersey is cheating. Even rookies. https://t.co/GfSiLm0ttk,1513775958154792963,AJ_HOU,767505369392263169
Honestly cod should switch to cross gaming with Consoles only let PC players hack and Cheat with each other 🤷🏻‍♂️ shit so hard to dial down with so many people looking for ways to exploit a game constantly. https://t.co/QUQgDp6p60,1513600308794036229,AJ_HOU,767505369392263169
