"Don’t expect many of these players to be there at pick 31. 

Kyler Gordon on that list stands out. The league may be higher on him than we think. They usually don’t invite players that they think aren’t first round locks. Hmmm

No Linderbaum on the list https://t.co/m8Jxll1trM",1514828037346541570,codiki,202435982

If the #Bengals take a guy like Alec Pierce early it helps lessen the need for the TE right away

You’d then have two WR over 6’4” with Alec/Higgins

You’d also have to elite downfield speed guys with Alec/Chase

It would make this offense DANGEROUS @JamesRapien",1514632335681110027,codiki,202435982
"Based on @espn analytics metrics. If the #Bengals were interested in Logan Hall they could safely move back to the late 30s with still a over 90% he’s available.

I doubt they’d just stick and pick but if they love him maybe they would. https://t.co/7a8fYu6Mlh",1514630495933456385,codiki,202435982

"That’s because one of the two can play football this year. 

If the Bengals were in rebuild mode they could look at Ojabo, but they are in win SBs mode. They need pick 31 to play this year. No guarantee with that for Ojabo https://t.co/UTLQzHjhjX",1514609826461933571,codiki,202435982
