"This video of #49ers Mike McGlinchey working out is encouraging. His weight is up and he looks to be recovering well from what was serious injury. 

Good news for the #Niners.

"Me (last week when Deebo news was going crazy): There’s no way the #49ers trade Deebo!

Me (this week after hearing from a few people who know more than I do): Oh, crap. Are the #Niners gonna trade Deebo?

I still don’t think so, but I’m not as confident this week. #49wz",1513602172197474308,49ersCamelot,2696853848
"The 1984 #49ers defense was really good. That team was 18-1 overall. The one loss came on a questionable call. 

The 1989 #Niners offense was explosive. Montana, Rice and Taylor were at their best. 

I picked the ‘89 team, but I probably should’ve picked the ‘84 team. https://t.co/9YWSH87sk7",1513600486544490497,49ersCamelot,2696853848

"If you are interested in who the #49ers could or should draft, my go-to guys are @sportslarryk, @BDPeacock, @JL_Chapman and @eric_crocker. 

When they talk #niners, I listen. https://t.co/1XumPkmYAB",1511167952095174657,49ersCamelot,2696853848
