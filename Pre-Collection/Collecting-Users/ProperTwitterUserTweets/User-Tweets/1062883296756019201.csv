I can’t believe we lost that Super Bowl. #bengals,1514711469732024323,BengalsGenius,1062883296756019201
Watching the beating Burrow took against Tennessee - there is no QB in the league who could have won that game besides Joe Burrow.,1513247465826308097,BengalsGenius,1062883296756019201
Sorry for your loss @steelers - It’s a tragic story. #Haskins,1513247196669485065,BengalsGenius,1062883296756019201
