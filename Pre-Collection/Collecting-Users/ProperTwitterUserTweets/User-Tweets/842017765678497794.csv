Back at work after a week long vacation. How many emails do I have? 😬,1514968388648333318,danideeds26,842017765678497794
So this picture just fell off my wall at almost 2am which of course woke me up in a panic. It made so much more noise than it should have though! I really thought like a whole wall came down with how loud and long the sound was. My heart is still racing 😂,1514889746891214849,danideeds26,842017765678497794
I watched this movie for the first time yesterday on the plane coming home and it was so good! Definitely a must-watch. https://t.co/bBYU9Mvvqf,1514709608123699201,danideeds26,842017765678497794

Everyone send positive vibes that the rain in the forecast is just a joke and the game plays as scheduled tonight! We flew to Minnesota to see the @Dodgers and I’m so excited to visit a new stadium 🤞🏻,1513888621354532873,danideeds26,842017765678497794
"I was low key hoping to see Kourtney Turner at Mall of America today after she said she would be going today on her podcast last week. I wasn’t paying close attention, but I was there for 5 hours and didn’t see her. Now I see that Justin was there too. Missed opportunity 😩",1513655209398095874,danideeds26,842017765678497794
It’s Mall of America day! I’ve been waiting so many years to come here!,1513543781471109127,danideeds26,842017765678497794
