"#AEWDynamite on TBS charted #3 on Cable on Wednesday with 0.37 (18-49) with 977,000 viewers. NBA Play in competition on ESPN took the Top 2 spots with 0.95 and 0.80 rating in 18-49. https://t.co/kbt0m2yoWY",1514707886714376198,JC1986_,4608843372
Still pretty much consistent with the numbers they been pulling lately. But their demo can take a hit when the real NBA Playoffs begins This Saturday and going forward until the NBA Finals ends. All numbers down slightly from last week. Still not bad. https://t.co/5PI5j7bDnq,1514695131462516746,JC1986_,4608843372
