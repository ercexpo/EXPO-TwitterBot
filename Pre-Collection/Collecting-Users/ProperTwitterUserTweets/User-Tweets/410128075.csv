I've been wanting to do one of these for a while. I really only started doing Twitter when COVID began and I have made some amazing connections and a few good friends. Thanks to all that make it fun here in THE COMIC ROOM. It's been great sharing. #comics #comicbooks #starwars https://t.co/acrTAclh9i,1514721651988078600,thecomicroom,410128075
