"Love seeing #RedSox prospects earning stars!! Yorke, Rafaela, and Groome. Don't forget about another Casas tater. I'd also like to shout out to a couple others who didn't make the cut. @RiverCats Bryce Johnson 3-6, 3 SB &amp; @VisaliaRawhide Jordan Lawlar stays hot 3-4, HR, SB. https://t.co/nmCvSzu6bp",1514618862884605952,Scotty_Ballgame,61390702
"Just another @WooSox Triston Casas üí£ over the mini monster at Polar Park. Not sure about Statcast but looks like it was 795', 149mph exit velocity. #RedSox #MiLB https://t.co/sjHWMwazPJ",1514410788286574592,Scotty_Ballgame,61390702

Pumped for @WooSox #413Night tonight and hopefully another Casas üí£ on his bobblehead night. Should be a great evening with friends and colleagues from @TheReminderMA and other #WesternMA business leaders. https://t.co/AlbPBeCpE2,1514240959114006532,Scotty_Ballgame,61390702

"#RedSoxNation, check out what #RedSox 2021 Minor League Pitcher of the Year Brandon Walter did yesterday for Double-A @PortlandSeaDogs ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/Mq4OjlimuH",1513522766166827012,Scotty_Ballgame,61390702
Ronny Mauricio bloops a double down the LF line. Brett Baty goes to third. Luke Ritter just walked to load the bases and that's the day for Hartford's Schilling. @GoYardGoats up 8-4 on Top 5th but @RumblePoniesBB rallying. #MiLB #LGM #Rockies https://t.co/Mc3dKHWfQE,1513224193151807498,Scotty_Ballgame,61390702
