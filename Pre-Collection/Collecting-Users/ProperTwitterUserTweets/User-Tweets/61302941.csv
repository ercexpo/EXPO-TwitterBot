"Sooo‚Ä¶I think some recency bias is setting in here among #Bears fans. Ryan Pace also used the one-year deal early and often when overhauling the roster.

It wasn‚Äôt until 2018 when he went after Mack, ARob &amp; re-signed his own draft picks that he started causing cap issues #DaBears https://t.co/7CCmagTBX7",1514584842377342983,ChiRuxinBGO,61302941

"Some days it's easy to be angry at the world. 
I'm having one of those days. 

My poor daughter is going on day 6 of vomiting and not being able to keep much down. COVID-19 for our two-year-old has not been fun. We are now trying to keep her hydrated - not easy. I'm defeated.",1513877404959358981,ChiRuxinBGO,61302941
"When we look at the WR draft class, there is plenty of value. The class is deep &amp; there are 5 WRs I consider first-rounders. 

That said, the top-end talent is not anywhere close to last year with Chase &amp; Waddle.

This is good for #DaBears who don't have a 1st-round pick though.",1513675715421650951,ChiRuxinBGO,61302941
