OMG there need to be accountability for MURDER by this cop https://t.co/ryxK9oeAhf,1514366226738425872,ThomasJJohnson4,951934958154797069
Racist views/opinions like yours is why there’s only been two Blacks on the court in over 200 years of the courts existence. https://t.co/gc7Wk8jBYq,1512418427767504896,ThomasJJohnson4,951934958154797069
What constitutional rights are those.  I think they voted for the constitutional rights of Justice Katanji Brown Jackson and EVERY African American in America.  They voted for the constitutional right of a Black Women to serve on the SCOTUS. https://t.co/gc7Wk8jBYq,1512417292415647751,ThomasJJohnson4,951934958154797069
After over 200 plus years of the SCOTUS it’s a SHAME that of 115 Justices only two have been black.  That changed on yesterday with the confirmation of JUSTICE Brown.  What’s even more SHAMEFUL is that most Republicans voted against her including Tim Scott.  SHAMEFUL!,1512415715701239809,ThomasJJohnson4,951934958154797069
