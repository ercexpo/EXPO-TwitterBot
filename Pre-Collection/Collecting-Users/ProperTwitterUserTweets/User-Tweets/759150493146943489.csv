Nice. https://t.co/xdbxKyEEhA",1514707135719956487,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
"Cost certainty will give Pirates more leverage in trade talks, IMO. Let's say, the cost for this CF just went up for any team looking in this direction for OF help. As for CLE, I'd suggest Guardians fans look elsewhere. https://t.co/BieTCFAOub",1514692546932486146,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
This is...good. That's a word. https://t.co/CJTQ9YC5ip,1514687194895912961,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
"I have Jackson Holliday as a top 10 talent on my draft board. Here's a look at him below. Hopefully, the Cubs (and others) bypass him and allow him to slip to no.16 for the Cleveland Guardians. https://t.co/KP0PvspqAj",1514682360150769668,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
Great to see Cantillo back healthy. Last season was a wash w/ an injury that cost him most of the season. Here's a good look at the young lefty &amp; notice a tighter more compact arm swing from earlier in his career. That should help improve his control &amp; possibly keep him healthy. https://t.co/ixZIIgSqFH,1514632617697681408,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
Brennan is a sleeper prospect in the system. Has the ability to fill all three spots and stop me if you heard it before an advanced approach at the plate. He has a good arm too and was up to 93 on the mound in college. https://t.co/h4Gs0E6bZh,1514631844209246213,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
"No, he doesn't have the same upside/stuff as an Espino or Williams.",1514420743307735041,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
Giving out credit where it belongs...Hedges with two walks today. Let's hope it's indicative of a better / improved approach at the plate.,1514357156027551749,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
As @coachsziber32 pointed out to be a more useful return would be an RP. I would be happy with an RP and a prospect (depending on the qlty of RP). https://t.co/R9yoA59lEI,1514270329681625094,WillHoo99,759150493146943489
