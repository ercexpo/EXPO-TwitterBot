"Below are the only Power 5 TEs who avg'd +2.00 Rec Yards per Team Pass Attempt in 2021

One is a potential day-2 pick in the 2022 draft: 
▫️ Greg Dulcich

The other was a true freshman🔥:
▫️ Brock Bowers

If you're looking to replace Kelce/Waller, Bowers could be your guy in 2024 https://t.co/zxrYNDFKXu",1513874625549283342,FF_MarvinE,1227804948131405824

"How do Breece Hall, Isaiah Spiller, and Kenneth Walker compare to the last decade of RB prospects?

"One of my favorite TEs in the 2022 class?

Greg Dulcich - UCLA

In 2020, Dulcich led all P5 TEs in (per game):

▫️ Rec Yds Market Share (32.9%)
▫️ Rec Yds per Team Pass Att (2.58)

... ahead of Kyle Pitts

He would follow that up in 2021 leading all P5 TEs again in both metrics https://t.co/VloIE8OBA3",1511702571857190912,FF_MarvinE,1227804948131405824
"Two of the most intriguing TEs in this class! @FFEvanlution and I discuss Ruckert’s potential and how much we love Dulcich’s upside at the next level.🔥
