I've been having a rough day so I turned on Homecoming. Didn't realize it was the anniversary. I remember the day it premiered like it was yesterday. I had just gotten back from PAA and had to go to work. So I watched in on my iphone at my desk all day lol. https://t.co/FNJahns0Im,1514731648998424578,asiahamina,68166826
