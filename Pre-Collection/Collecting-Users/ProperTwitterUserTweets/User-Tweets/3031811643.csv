"I do not know why so many Hanshin fans are mad.

I only pointed out that they are 1-10 and that a lady got beat up outside  koshien.  I'm sure that happens every day in Osaka. https://t.co/XZJWKJ8X87",1511800297055694851,alohano_1,3031811643

"They're Osaka people.  What do you expect?  

Losers are losers.  When you come from an awful place you end up awful. https://t.co/gPvCihx3TO",1511380212822396931,alohano_1,3031811643
Why don't the Baystars put that Osaka garbage at the top of the wing seats at Hamasta??? https://t.co/DmbxnvjxSG,1511226945345785856,alohano_1,3031811643
"You dumbass Nihonjins.  Ohtani hits a home run and you all get freaked out?  So what?

Is he going to the World Series?  Is going to win a championship?

His team is going nowhere and Ohtani is going nowhere.

He will watch the playoffs as long as he plays for the Angels.",1510856890489528323,alohano_1,3031811643
"Get in the game.  You are paid to play, not paid to practice. https://t.co/3FqSgaV2tk",1510180062280118273,alohano_1,3031811643
"I'm glad they lost!

Horrible pitching decisions, lousy players playing lousy.

You stupid Baystars fans....face it.

If you have Yamashita, Sekine, etc on your team your team sucks.... and will never win.

This is completely Soto's and Austin's fault too.
