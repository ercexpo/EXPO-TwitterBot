"A lot of locks I‚Äôve seen had Stingley going in the 9-14 range. I wonder if a team will look to jump Seattle at 9 to get him? If the big 3 or 4 EDGEs are off the board at 8 for Atlanta, a trade back would be perfect for them. https://t.co/X8bKiRM1Vm",1511744332990230533,_CodyStewart,341534560
"Dream scenario for the Giants on top of this would be both Neal and Ekwonu are on the board at 5. Saints trade up to take a QB obviously, and the Giants are still able to get OT at 7.

My boys third NASCAR race and it may be his favorite so far. He loved having the headphones and scanner so we could listen to the drivers. He was acting like a Crew Chief the whole time. We came for some racing and left with a bunch of memories. I love being a Dad ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/wHV4xOr1PY,1510771072647499777,_CodyStewart,341534560
