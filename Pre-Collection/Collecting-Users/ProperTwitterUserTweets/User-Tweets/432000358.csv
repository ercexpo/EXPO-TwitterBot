"Romero's DAWN set the standard for zombie satire and gore effects going forward. It's more than just a simple horror film; it's a masterpiece of its genre. Sn*der's DAWN is fitfully energetic yet full of his typical misogynist, homophobic rhetoric hidden under a glossy sheen. https://t.co/FD6XEmd3zS",1514694990978453525,DWLundberg,432000358
"Yeah, NO SHIT. This shouldn't be a controversial statement. https://t.co/5iirQUqDtO",1514693412057878538,DWLundberg,432000358
"IN TWO DAYS... ""As if!"" ""She's a full-on Monet."" ""I was like totally buggin'."" ""You been jeepin' behind my back?"" ""Whatever!"" ""Anything happens to my daughter, I got a .45 and a shovel."" These memorable quotes—PLUS MORE!—when NostalgiaCast covers CLUELESS this Friday at 10am MST! https://t.co/HYTSYVlcrU",1514442066230718470,DWLundberg,432000358
"So lemme get this straight... people saw this and DIDN'T automatically add Michelle Yeoh to their ""This actress is awesome and I must become aware of everything she's associated with"" list? Wait... did people even see CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON? Are people stupid? https://t.co/pUwc7CGH1U",1514398230875820032,DWLundberg,432000358
"We covered FOOTLOOSE for NostalgiaCast and basically decided that the narrative is too disjointed to work as an actual MOVIE, but the soundtrack is A+ and the ending sends you out on such a high that it certainly FEELS like the greatest movie.

"Listen, I'm a big admirer of THE LAST JEDI myself, but takes like this can be dangerous since you're basically pigeonholing people into believing they're WRONG for not thinking the same as you. It's akin to saying ""THE LAST JEDI sucks because you didn't understand it ENOUGH."" https://t.co/LJ7CA4IRV9",1514332604354502657,DWLundberg,432000358
Just give me a goshdamn Superman film where he flies around saving people without feeling conflicted about it and inspires everyone around him to become better versions of themselves. HOW HARD IS THAT? https://t.co/gRmPixFSNb,1514317502364459009,DWLundberg,432000358
"My hot take of the day:

John Woo’s THE KILLER is 50x more operatic, introspective, and thrilling than John Woo’s HARD BOILED. And I loooooove HARD BOILED. https://t.co/evIPk1mzTS",1514306247054438405,DWLundberg,432000358
