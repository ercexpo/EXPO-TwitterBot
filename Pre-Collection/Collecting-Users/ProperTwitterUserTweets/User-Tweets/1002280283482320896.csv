"Great base running by Tony Kemp, waited on the ground ball to get the run across and was still safe at second. Veteran move",1514669698654294024,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
"Patrick Beverly knows how to market himself, and he does it very well",1514351113335676928,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
"That’s a good pitch from Diekman. He’s been money for the Red Sox so far. Crawford had good stuff, just lacks location and has a lot of time to develop. The Red Sox pitching hasn’t been the problem, they can be competitive if Kike, JBJ, Vazquez, and Bobby are just average",1514342104008429568,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
I’ve always been a JBJ fan. Glad to see him get his first hit in a big moment with 2 on 2 out,1514309174909415429,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
"Just bought tickets to Nets-Celtics game 2. See you soon (and for the first time), TD☘️☘️☘️",1514288585779957761,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
"Act like you’ve been there before, you just made the playoffs. Lit to watch though, I was hype for Pat Bev",1514098818488442880,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
"Reactionary foul calls are horrible for the game of basketball. If it’s a foul it’s a foul, shouldn’t rely on the ball going in (or not going in) the basket to make a call",1514026546767568906,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
"Stop judging MLB teams 4 games into the season. You have another 56 games before you can really determine what direction the squad is going on. Simmer down it’s April, got a long ways to go before October",1513683856762753036,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
"Joel Embiid is a dominant force, he needs his Kobe. I don’t think Harden is efficient or Mamba-esque enough in his mentality to propel the Sixers to a championship but we shall see. Just imagine Booker or Doncic with Embiid",1513257590842695680,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
Rest In Peace Dwayne Haskins,1512824048757223439,OzziePearlman,1002280283482320896
