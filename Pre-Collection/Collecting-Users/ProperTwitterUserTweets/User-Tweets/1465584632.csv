"Just TAX THE RICH.

"I was a monthly sustainer, and I was so saddened to get the emails today. @BitchMedia seemed like the rare success story, the independent voice that became an institution, although always underfunded and scrappy. RIP. https://t.co/RuUjbgb9eu",1514499314319470594,AnooshInTheSun,1465584632

"I was afraid that something happened to Jimmy Carter, but it's just ""conservatives"" trying to bad-mouth Democrats.

Carter was a decent President, and is the most extraordinary ex-President of my lifetime. I was the only kid in my class who wanted to re-elect him. Still proud.",1514105593551745029,AnooshInTheSun,1465584632
