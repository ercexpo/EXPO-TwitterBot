I worry about Casey Mize..just bad at strategy and execution..we are in year 3..not good enough to outsmart/execute guys..not swaggy enough to overpower them..its not new..I seem to explain these issues every start..doesn't hold runner..doesn't get ahead..doesn't much of anything,1514780872947363849,sportz5176,410827635
Mize navigating through the first 13 hitters somehow scoreless..49 pitches 22 fastballs KC has swing and missed one time at Mize's FB..once..living on borrowed time if you can't induce more swing and misses at you FB than that,1514774613342924801,sportz5176,410827635
Barnhart just gained a little cred with me..,1514770137680736256,sportz5176,410827635
If you throw soft away I will murder you,1514769950904184832,sportz5176,410827635
on his 28th pitch Casey Mize gets his FIRST swing and miss..but its a huge one..,1514769317245571079,sportz5176,410827635
to roster Dustin Garneau instead of a real MLB caliber SS on their bench..is a question I need answered @CodyStavenhagen,1514768576703459331,sportz5176,410827635
man oh man is KC doing a lot of stupid baseball things tonight,1514768289032929286,sportz5176,410827635
whats abundantly clear..Casey Mize's command is a fable..but I promise there will be a long winded excuse why it not quite right..,1514768058119704580,sportz5176,410827635
can I open my eyes now..is he safe,1514764334810902563,sportz5176,410827635
Thumb bruises are nasty..really tough to hit well with them..especially in cold weather..the smart play is to DL him for 10 days and bring up Kreidler..but Baez is stubborn so they won't and then he will hit .218 for the next month,1514757877327618054,sportz5176,410827635
