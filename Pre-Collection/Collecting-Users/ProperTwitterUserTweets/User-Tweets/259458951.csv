"Hot take Thursday: #TikTok ruined an entire generation of music. You get in the car, hear a song that’s in every TikTok vid, and change the station because all you can think of is vids you scroll through ever morning that you don’t like",1514565891316453376,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
Yup I’m missing Game 1 or at least the first half. Ugh https://t.co/ml98F09j2T,1514060843159363584,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
Brooklyn is playing “Shipping up to Boston” and the fans are chanting “We want Boston”. Let’s have some fun,1514053721788923907,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
Kyrie and Durant are playing close to 40 minutes in a game that should be over. It’s for the best we play the Nets. We need to know how good Tatum and Brown really are,1514050069225484292,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
Knowing my luck the #Celtics will be playing at 1pm on Sunday when I won’t be home https://t.co/HZ3QEadsTx,1513608807729045507,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
"I used to be envious and jealous of people who seemed to have it all materialistically; the cars, the money, and the notoriety. Today I just don’t care anymore. Everything I’m striving for is personal growth, building my business, and to continue enjoying the process.",1513288618634272779,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
Congrats Milwaukee. Have fun playing Brooklyn 😂,1512248681226981376,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
Win or lose this is a statement game. The #Bucks can’t feel good after tonight with the #Celtics sitting half of their starters,1512245263762657281,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
Is the #Celtics bench and role players this good or are the #Bucks overhyped?,1512234833774358554,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
Are we really supposed to fear the Bucks? If everyone was playing tonight the #Celtics would be up double digits,1512231378603192346,Mike_Cerra_,259458951
