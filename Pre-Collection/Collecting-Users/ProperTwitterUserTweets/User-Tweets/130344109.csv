"I don't know who this girl is, and wouldn't normally endorse something like this (I have a wife, and I care about my mortal well-being) but if you're into OnlyFans accounts this is the one you should be subscribing to. https://t.co/vXfjCkk6CE",1514682567701762051,Ross_Wheatley,130344109

"Random thought. MJF has started throwing challengers at Wardlow to try &amp; neutralize him. Obviously, the efforts will be futile. But what if 1 of the challengers was brought in from outside AEW? Like a specific ""kayfabe"" unstoppable force, &amp; fellow member of the Jewish community?",1514613135214145537,Ross_Wheatley,130344109
"So, I'm not saying this isn't possible. However, it's my understanding TK had a sort of ""backup"" announcement in the event the ROH sale didn't go through as planned. I'm inclined to think the upcoming announcement is whatever that was, which would rule out anything involving ROH. https://t.co/X3EyXOEssx",1514603595919855617,Ross_Wheatley,130344109
"Angry thought to start my Thursday morning. If you were dismissing Satnam Singh as some form of ""Great Khali 2.0"" you're ignorant and racist. Please do better and/or unfollow me.",1514570711947517963,Ross_Wheatley,130344109
"We've all got an opinion on that ending, but I think AEW fans should be excited about Satnam Singh. He's only 26, is shoot one of the tallest wrestlers of all time, and shares a locker room with someone who was once a sensational young giant himself.",1514433083487002625,Ross_Wheatley,130344109
"I'm gonna try a joke and let Twitter eviscerate me for it if they want.

Maybe next week Kenny will have Don 69 him again to draw our attention away from that ending.",1514429980591153157,Ross_Wheatley,130344109
"Stoked that Satnam Singh has arrived, but that was probably the absolute last way I would have debuted him on television. Like, maybe even mention publically ONCE that you've been training a 7'3 monster before presenting him as a ""surprise."" #AEWDynamite",1514424499017555973,Ross_Wheatley,130344109
"If I'm Joe, I'd be praying Suzuki would just start punching me in the jaw at this point. My god, Joe's chest. #AEW",1514421339146395656,Ross_Wheatley,130344109
"People aren't ready for the psychology of Daniel Garcia. Throwing the short punches while taking the Three Amigos, then digging the bat into Kingston's ribs? Kid is on a different level. #AEWDynamite",1514411194429411332,Ross_Wheatley,130344109
