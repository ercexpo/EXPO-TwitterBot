"This quote is going to get laughed at, but I really do think Russell Wilson has a rare, hyper-focused “let’s go!” type of leadership mentality. He’s also calm, collected. He’s a leader. An oddball, sure, but a leader. https://t.co/tY1QXQooyQ",1514737199253803010,BrentSchwartzz,186555971
"Interesting convo. I feel like when it's all said and done, we could have a similar discussion with both Tom Brady and Bill Belichick regarding the #Patriots near-perfect 2007 season. https://t.co/rV4HdEttEH",1514655169681760259,BrentSchwartzz,186555971
Back in North Carolina for a little bit. Pollen is absolutely kicking my ass. Gets worse every year. Send help.,1514564137694683138,BrentSchwartzz,186555971
"Phenomenal season finale, phenomenal first season. 

#Severance  is must-watch TV. Can’t wait for S2. https://t.co/HOEtmE5JfY",1514395650913353735,BrentSchwartzz,186555971
Celtics-Nets. Meant to be. Helluva first-round draw.,1514054657743671304,BrentSchwartzz,186555971
#Severance  time. Three episodes in and I’m captivated. I may honestly watch the remaining six episodes tonight. I heard the finale is a masterpiece. I’ve done a good job avoiding spoilers.,1514004335813804032,BrentSchwartzz,186555971
"I think the #Patriots will do a lot of this on 3rd down/obvious passing situations this season.

Especially when you look at how well the ‘rush 3 or 4, drop 7 or 8’ fast/competent zone D worked in spurts last year vs. top O’s. I could see NE in 2-high w/ safeties at LB often https://t.co/7ib5JWGi7D",1513992385327419400,BrentSchwartzz,186555971
"Last day of NBA regular season! 

As it stands, the East and West represent both sides of the coin when it comes to the play-in tourney. A great year for the idea in the East. Looks ridiculous for even existing in the West. https://t.co/O4X4lXE7hK",1513144377044086787,BrentSchwartzz,186555971
