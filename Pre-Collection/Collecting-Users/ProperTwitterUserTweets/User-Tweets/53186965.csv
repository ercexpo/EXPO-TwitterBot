Last night was very frustrating for me but I can't and won't be mad at the Clippers for how things went. They've overachieved all season long and I'm grateful for how they fought to even be in this position. Let's get the next one.,1514320513685929993,timothythetooth,53186965
Morris is trying to get himself traded this off season or???,1514082097761202184,timothythetooth,53186965
I don't see any adjustments on offense other then try to get a 5th foul on KAT ball.,1514081972900880385,timothythetooth,53186965
Powell was on fire and Lue waiting way too long bringing him back in. Some weird Lue coaching decisions.,1514078702484680706,timothythetooth,53186965
The offense turned too predictable with PG bringing the ball up. He needs to give it up and get down court. He's also too slow bringing it up.,1514076569425244160,timothythetooth,53186965
PG dribbling the ball the whole possession is not good basketball. We don't need hero ball.,1514068690878099458,timothythetooth,53186965

Why would any other team in the league want Westbrook on their team? He's never going to be a Vince Carter type vet.,1513638903000928264,timothythetooth,53186965
