"If you wonder why they are less and less black players in MLB, it's because MLB has yet to address any social injustice issues when it comes to the sport. I'll never see a black owner in MLB in my entire lifetime. I've made a realization on this. It's such a damn travesty.",1514975194233950214,RazzleDazzle427,574719306
"I love how MLB celebrates Jackie Robinson Day but still has yet to address the lack of black GM's/Owners in the sport. MLB has always been notorious for it's racist views and policies but hey 'we'll throw you a bone and celebrate Jackie"". It's a complete PR move by the sport.",1514974856802185220,RazzleDazzle427,574719306
