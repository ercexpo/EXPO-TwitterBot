THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF MASSIVE TALENT is a hilarious time at the movies. Nicholas Cage goes full Meta making fun of himself and having a great time. A love letter to his career and fun buddy comedy. Pedro Pascal kills it as well. 7/10. #unbearableweightofmassivetalent #review https://t.co/V1JdXIvaP7,1514614326463655937,JoshBlumenkranz,29622771
