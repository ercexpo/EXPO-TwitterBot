The worst part about Chapman’s outing yesterday was that it was a pretty easy and low stress save opportunity. It was 3-0 with 7-8-9 up. That’s not a situation I would consider even getting Loiasiga pitching the 9th and Chapman couldn’t even throw half of his pitches for strikes,1514959737028325377,cyanks24,1159143904853266432
