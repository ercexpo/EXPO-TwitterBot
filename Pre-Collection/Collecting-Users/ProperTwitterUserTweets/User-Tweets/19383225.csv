"Again, I'd like to see Ynoa get a chance to get himself back on track at AAA.

"The WS champs have added or will add:

- An MVP caliber player
- The 2020 version of Ozuna (apparently)
- TWO of baseball's top relievers
- Will likely add a 2019 CY contender in second half
- And could add another dominant reliever (Yates) later

Do I have to defend bullishness?",1514703898493304833,FriedBasballATL,19383225
"I'm not always optimistic about the Braves. 

I BURIED this team mid-way through last year.  Stuck a fork in 'em. 

But now ... I find it amusing that I catch crap from some for being bullish on a team that just won the World Series AND got significantly better this year.",1514702876555288580,FriedBasballATL,19383225

But I maintain my prediction that the Braves will win the East by several games and it won't be a final week nail biter. 

And I'm never wrong.

"I'm confident that: 

1) Wright has turned a corner, is now a top-half of rotation starter

2) Ian will settle in soon

3) Soroka will return in the second half

4) The Braves rotation will continue to improve (barring terrible injury trouble), and will be top-3 in MLB by Sept.",1514680951917486089,FriedBasballATL,19383225
