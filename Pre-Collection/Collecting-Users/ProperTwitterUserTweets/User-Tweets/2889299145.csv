becos those people dont care about dc. they want dc to remain a non threat to marvel/disney or best guess reduced to sh*t more so that discovery may be forced to sell &amp; disney most likely buys dc. it was never about dark tone. wbros &amp; fakeass fans got played https://t.co/J8WisVQ9vX,1514970971999977473,daamiedwards,2889299145
"becos batfleck literally was a shadow &amp; terror upon criminals &amp; sex trafffickers. unlike batboy who spies on women undressing, takes drugs, walks up &amp; knocks on front doors of corrupt establishments &amp; pretends to be a doctor. https://t.co/BuhRjuh5UM",1514969284430213124,daamiedwards,2889299145
"snyder fans have genuine non bot accounts, passion traction &amp; hype that rivals &amp; can beat marvel in some cases. grace &amp; wbros knows this. thats why she used snyder &amp; us to boost her channel/following &amp; wbros used snydercut &amp; us to get subs &amp; boost hbomax. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse https://t.co/bQStqM7O2Y",1514968341999501319,daamiedwards,2889299145
"real or not oscar. fans winning those two oscars for snyder proved that we arent bots &amp; we have organization passion traction &amp; hype that can rival or even beat disney/marvel. $1B box office per film was coming, wbros just ruined the harvest in 2016/2017. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse https://t.co/TfhkxSJtUP",1514966941080993794,daamiedwards,2889299145
sorry but i rather see robert liefeld run a new discovery dc comics company than jim lee or geoff judas johns. those two idiots had their chance. lee &amp; johns backstabbed snyder. overhaul the entire dc company for real. they tarnished the brand. movie superman shelved for 5 yrs,1514966033517494273,daamiedwards,2889299145
"correct me if im wrong but didnt someone calculate snydercut's views on all other apps besides hbomax, with cinema ticket prices in regards to if snydercut was released in cinemas &amp; the total came up to $600-$700M? #RestoreTheSnyderVerse https://t.co/mGF7qiVZuM",1514965176981860357,daamiedwards,2889299145
"It was all about $ in 2016 regards to batman v superman-$873M. But MOS BVS SS &amp; WW=$3B box office &amp; $4B merchandise. Snyder was removed bcos BVS didnt make $1B. SHAZ BOP WW TSS BATBOY all made less dan BVS.

josstice league crashed. shazam bop ww84 gunn squad &amp; batboy made less $ than BVS. JOKER's $500M profit went to other studios &amp; the director. wbros/dc $80B value fell to $40B. but loser scoopers &amp; verifieds are still saying in 2022 'dc needs a fiege'? #RestoreTheSndyerVerse https://t.co/1APxNoN7fB,1514953527432552452,daamiedwards,2889299145
"it was too hard hitting for crybabies but its true. good lord i could only imagine d wonders terrio, snyder &amp; affleck couldve done for dceu/batman if they werent stopped in 2016. terrio literally sat down with ray to discuss launching cyborg powerfully &amp; properly filmwise. https://t.co/CHoM7G7YqZ",1514949380230553603,daamiedwards,2889299145
