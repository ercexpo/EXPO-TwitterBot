"Is $22M the most any player has made in a single season with the Cleveland Indians/Guardians?

Encarnacion made $18M in 2017 ($13M + $5M signing) and $17M in 2018. Lindor was at $17.3M in arbitration in 2020 (pre-proration). Was anyone even at $20M ever?

"So with the Ramirez deal offical, I have Cleveland's Opening Day payroll in the $67-71M range, depending how much you want to credit Straw on ""opening day""

It's right around $70M now.

I'm not saying whether this is or isn't good enough, but 40% increase over 2021.

"I still can't get over Cleveland keeping Bobby Bradley all winter and then just ghosting him after Game 2.

Like...we all knew who he is. That he was out of options. Not even saying it's been the wrong move but just a very weird handling of him...

I get you want to get guys work in that pen so Sandlin out there is fine. But with a 6 run lead this felt like a great time to get Konnor Pilkington his first appearance. Now that it's only a 4 run lead no way they bring him out in the 9th...,1514336162382594065,MattB_WOF,1018730815
I've been and still am a big fan of Josh Naylor long-term...but I still think letting him play more at Columbus is the smart move. Even if it requires optioning him there. Do it. I don't get why he's being forced back onto big league roster already...,1514329111543652359,MattB_WOF,1018730815
