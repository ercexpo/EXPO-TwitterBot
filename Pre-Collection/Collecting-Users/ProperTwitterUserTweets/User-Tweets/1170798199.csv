My take on today game first it was a great game proud of Chelsea for giving it all they had and making Real Madrid suffer for 120+min.

They just Robbed the LAFC that wasnâ€™t an offside it hits the LA players and the first Vela goal wasnâ€™t offside either LAFC should have won 3-2 or least tied. 2-2,1512973307741712397,Big_Ed9,1170798199
