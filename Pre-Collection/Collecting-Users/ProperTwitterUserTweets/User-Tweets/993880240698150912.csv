All imma say is that this in flight wifi better be working cuz I can’t stop watching this White Sox offense in the rain! #WhiteSox,1514401338263846914,OfficialBillyH,993880240698150912
TA getting things started early as it feels he always does with a blooper into short LF. Sox gotta capitalize on this!,1514394594804445184,OfficialBillyH,993880240698150912
And Dallas Keuchel is back to mid season form giving up an absolute no doubter to Mariner’s 1B Ty France on his 5th pitch of the game. White Sox going to have to hit 2021 Cy Young award winner Robbie Ray hard to stay in this one.,1514393538720579588,OfficialBillyH,993880240698150912
"You’d have to imagine if #WhiteSox want to get Frankie Montas and Vaughn is for not included in a deal, Sheets, Burger, Cespedes, Montgomery, Kelley, and other top prospects are definitely going to talked about in a possible return package. I’m all on board for keeping GS and AV.",1513871134734790660,OfficialBillyH,993880240698150912
#KayRodCast what college intern sat down and said ya this will be a good idea? Were there no Hall of Famers interested?,1513294012173717504,OfficialBillyH,993880240698150912
