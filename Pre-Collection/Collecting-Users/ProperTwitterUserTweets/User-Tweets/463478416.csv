"Eric Silva has ACE potential. The curve and slider have great break. The 2nd inning was strange. 4 straight balls and just a lost of command (on more than 1 occasion). I'd argue he needs to mix more fastballs into his arsenal. A lot of breaking stuff

"Hidden ðŸ’Ž Alert: 
Luis Peralta 
I don't know much about him. 
But he's throwing one of the best Lo-A curveballs I've seen in some time.

"Really bad start for Franco Aleman. He's got stuff to throw. Control is just very off. Saw a nice curve at the end of the inning, just located high. Rnd 10 pick so not expecting much in 1st start. Just bad command.

"No disrespect to Rhyne Howard
Atlanta is laughed at if they propose that package if Clarke or Bueckers are available to be drafted.

"Oakland couldn't possibly have a worse hitter at 3B than Kevin Smith. 
Welp, Sheldon Neuse disagrees 
Why the f*ck did he chase that Raley curve?! That pitch dropped before it got to the batters box. 
Nuese had no shot

"It would be so Sacramento Kangz to fire Luke Walton and then his permanent replacement (D'Antoni) running the same ""No-D, All-Offense"" system Walton used. Better make sure you have a solid assistant coach ready to take over.

"I know I'm obviously the 1st person to tweet @GVartwork about making a Kwan shirt.
Since I was the first (because I know nobody has asked) I should get it free (because nobody has asked so there probably won't be a demand). 
Let me know, guys. I'll wear it across Northern Cali",1513711013681455104,DGentleman9288,463478416
