You being up Gorman and throw him at second and then put Edman at shortstop you also create a more balanced lineup with a left handed hitter being in there,1514785967529287687,jonah2052,948736909655924737
"Honestly this I think should happen: Gorman gets called up to play second then switch Edman to shortstop, play Noot over Dickerson, keep Pujols in for lefties and some righties, and a hot take but keep Yepez in AAA this year",1514780529370968073,jonah2052,948736909655924737
Tommy please just bat right handed and stop with this switch hitter stuff,1514740698548948999,jonah2052,948736909655924737
Pauly D needs to hit right here,1514735417718935555,jonah2052,948736909655924737
Do we honestly have one of the worst starting rotations in all of baseball? @Cardinals,1514734029064609793,jonah2052,948736909655924737
Man our starting pitching is atrocious ðŸ˜¡,1514733034213462027,jonah2052,948736909655924737
Is this the first 3 hit game since he hit 3 home runs against the Rangers in 2011? @Cardinals,1514061932684353536,jonah2052,948736909655924737
Edman stop the switch hitter stuff and bat righty full time please,1514052660688732160,jonah2052,948736909655924737
Whoever is watching the game is Kinzer not setting up in the right spots? Every off speed pitch is missing the zone almost,1514048763890966529,jonah2052,948736909655924737
Hudson needs to throw his sinkers almost all the time he just needs to get them down a little bit. Idk if he is missing his spots or the placement being called is off especially for his off speed pitches,1514043993763495940,jonah2052,948736909655924737
