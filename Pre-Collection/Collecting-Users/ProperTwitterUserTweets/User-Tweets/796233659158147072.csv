Depressed and want to physically be left alone but I'm not home to escape being bothered :/,1513334690442215428,RubyGirl_14,796233659158147072
"I really don't need my mom bitching at me for my partner taking a week off while the truck is getting fixed. Oh how dare he doesn't wanna try and bust his ass to make a check and pay for a rental truck. She doesn't and WILL NOT know I'm struggling, but we'll deal.",1513020262496849920,RubyGirl_14,796233659158147072
"I'm stressed and I don't even have time to be stressed.

And it sucks seeing all your friends going out and having fun and I'm here spending money I don't have because of the stupid fucking truck we have keeps fucking us over.",1512673223095164928,RubyGirl_14,796233659158147072
"With the way things are, I don't know if I can afford BLFC, and if I do, I won't have money for anything at all. I'm screwed.",1512672028356059140,RubyGirl_14,796233659158147072

"Happy #TransDayOfVisibilty !

I'm proud to be Trans-Masc and Genderfluid despite all the issues it brings me. I can never be open about it around my family, and because of my weight I don't pass the way I used to; but I'm still trying every day to try and be who I really am.",1509579348520493063,RubyGirl_14,796233659158147072
"Sometimes it's hard to cope without someone who can empathize with me and help me thru my issues. It's hard knowing he can't understand my emotions and how much they affect me. Even simple things can bring my whole world down. 

I think that's why I feel so alone sometimes.",1508698511042220032,RubyGirl_14,796233659158147072

And the other option is... Yes let me and my partner feel miserable together.",1508325766685085697,RubyGirl_14,796233659158147072
"I have to vent, because it's frustrating having people tell me ""Oh we're all struggling with the cost of everything going up""

Notably, the price of fuel.

Most people with jobs get the same paycheck/hrs, now they have to make it stretch on that same amount.

NOT US.",1508135887074299909,RubyGirl_14,796233659158147072
