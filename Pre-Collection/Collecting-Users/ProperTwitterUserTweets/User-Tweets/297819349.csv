Late night cranking over here at @StudioCincoNYC. Bouncing between painting and Kickstarter fulfillment. ERRATICA and NEON SPRING pair well together.

"HBD 2 @GoodGr8Grossman! Co-creator/writer of @goofyfroot, NOT SO SUPER DAVE &amp; more, editor of NEON SPRING &amp; all around great guy. This is definitely not a sticker he made using the art I made of him &amp; it’s definitely not for sale.  Wish him a HBD, but don’t mention this sticker😉 https://t.co/C7DBK0kjec",1514440119956160514,Ian_Cinco,297819349
