"Iâ€™ve now heard all the alternative albums that were nominated for the Grammy and think Arlo Parks or Japanese Breakfast shouldâ€™ve taken it over St. Vincent. Just my opinion. 
Arloâ€™s â€˜Collapsed in Sunbeamsâ€™ is superb, a MUST listen.",1511004180613410818,LolaB2004,201487276
Listening to music I came across Japanese Breakfast. They remind me of The Sundays with a definite 90s dream pop sound. I already added their three albums to my current alternative music Spotify list. ðŸ’—ðŸ˜Œ,1510974111878631427,LolaB2004,201487276

Can I work @SanAntonioZoo now? I was a vet tech from 1992-2000 and I love animals. Iâ€™ll even scoop rhino poo. #serenitynow,1510724724824936450,LolaB2004,201487276
