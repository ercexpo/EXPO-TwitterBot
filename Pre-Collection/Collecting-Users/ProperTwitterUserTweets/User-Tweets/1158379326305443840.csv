"I’ve already finalized my scores for “There Is Nothing Left To Lose” from @foofighters…episode in 2 weeks…but what’s your Top Song on this one?

We had a collective least favorite song. Any guesses what that one is? #FooFighters https://t.co/tZYUgmChbQ",1514754316351033344,PodcastRecords,1158379326305443840
"Released on April 14, 1989, ""Say Anything"" is one of Cameron Crowe's most endearing films.  And, we gushed on the soundtrack back in 2019.  Any guesses what I picked for top song?

What's your top song?

"It's here.
Full disclosure...we recorded this episode before the tragic news about Taylor.  So, it still mentions that I'm seeing them live in North Carolina for my birthday weekend.  Those plans of course have sadly changed.

This was a fun way to kick off the ""sidecast."" Enjoy! https://t.co/JXDRmJsIAH",1514603392148000772,PodcastRecords,1158379326305443840
"“Bleed American” from Jimmy Eat World is first spin of the day. I needed to hear “Praise Chorus” this morning. Not even sure why…just had the chorus in my head.

Whatcha got for favorites on this one? It’s OK if you say the obvious “The Middle” because it’s a dang fine song. https://t.co/7ia6ept3OS",1514588182410637317,PodcastRecords,1158379326305443840
"“Welcome 2 America” from his majesty Prince is next up.

What does everyone think of this album? Where does this stack up in the discography? https://t.co/rM1nq0tWcp",1514309241389170688,PodcastRecords,1158379326305443840
"Who's ready for the first episode of our Foo Fighters sidecast?  We've got a special guest for the first one...Barrett Jones who co-produced the album with Dave.

"Thanks for the shoutout guys about our upcoming Foo Fighters series. 1st episode comes out tomorrow!

"Next two listens…solo albums from two lead singers from huge bands…”Wanderlust” from Gavin Rossdale of Bush &amp; “Master of the Game” from James “J.T.” Taylor of Kool &amp; The Gang.

Which do you choose to play first? Are either of these solo albums worth keeping? https://t.co/xt7cFyMEHu",1514247079631245313,PodcastRecords,1158379326305443840
"Starting the morning with some Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. There are soooo many hits that they missed on this compilation. I guess they weren’t “Super Hits?”

Biggest omission to me is “After the Thrill is Gone.” What else did they miss for this CD? https://t.co/2bwDJLInGF",1514216241883652098,PodcastRecords,1158379326305443840
