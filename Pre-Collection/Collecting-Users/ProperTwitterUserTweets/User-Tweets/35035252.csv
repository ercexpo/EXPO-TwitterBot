They have to name drop Hayley tonight. The show hardly has acknowledged her at all. https://t.co/rkeaXO9zXk,1514707577413812239,Alex_Chatman,35035252
Such a toxic environment they are. Really need to get Danielle and the cast outta there. #FreeDRR https://t.co/3un3aWeyHk,1514700755852488705,Alex_Chatman,35035252
"Those two sorry ships has no growth. Its the same toxic BS with them. At least with Hosie, its growth together and separately. https://t.co/Q9wcvcuO3F",1514688751640977419,Alex_Chatman,35035252
None of them at that show is Innocent. LOL https://t.co/OyOc2csfyQ,1514679977828098050,Alex_Chatman,35035252

The immaturity of the New intern on the Writers account,1514678104731619335,Alex_Chatman,35035252
"If this show had ""The Originals"" writers. Man that show would of a been a Winner https://t.co/7BUdJNeWVL",1514677359609274372,Alex_Chatman,35035252
Hosie was the biggest opportunity the show had at a root worthy ship. One that had your typical TV slow burn. Both characters had the potential to complete each other and lead to individual growth for each other. The show blew that opportunity. Wasted time on a Toxic ship instead,1514675724409524231,Alex_Chatman,35035252
That fandom is so pathetic. Peak Losers https://t.co/gmyVd6WXVc,1514672522175918084,Alex_Chatman,35035252
