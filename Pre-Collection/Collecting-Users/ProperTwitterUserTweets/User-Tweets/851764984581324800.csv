Love this! Both the initial skepticism (I get it‚Ä¶) and the rationalization as to why the statistical trepidation around Albert signing may not be justified. https://t.co/EId254Nqam,1509173089434808323,HopelessRedbird,851764984581324800

"I‚Äôm curious to see exactly how the platoons work;who gets what matchup and what‚Äôs the lineup on any given day; how many PAs do Pujols, Dickerson, Yepez, &amp; Gorman each get; etc. 

But that‚Äôs all for another day. Pujols is coming home and I‚Äôm friggin‚Äô elated. #STLCards https://t.co/oebYQwbxJz",1508434487604092930,HopelessRedbird,851764984581324800
I‚Äôm going to need the @Cardinals social media team to bring their A-game over the next few days. This is something #STLCards fans have been waiting for for 11 years. Can‚Äôt mail this in‚Ä¶,1508407477255163911,HopelessRedbird,851764984581324800
Can‚Äôt believe this happened. So happy to see him back with the #STLCards Give him 1-year deals until he‚Äôs ready to be done. Albert needs to retire a Cardinal. https://t.co/xKv8CNcxvW,1508391674455732226,HopelessRedbird,851764984581324800
"I HATE this rule, and it is a mistake to bring it back. It artificially ends games early and is overly harsh to the losing team. 

The best comp is 3-on-3 OT &amp; shootouts in the NHL, but there‚Äôs a big difference‚Ä¶ The use of a points system for standings. https://t.co/lL7NHXTEy5",1506615619512422402,HopelessRedbird,851764984581324800
