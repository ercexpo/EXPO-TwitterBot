It's unbelievable how much Ty France gets hit by pitches. I feel like he doesn't crowd the plate that much... He just doesn't bail. @colingawel @james_baumann @northcoastposse His Mariners single season record in 2021 already in jeopardy.,1514710366219124738,BriAltStation,16364888
My God. What the hell is wrong with people. https://t.co/Ea5Pv7cWuB,1514266193380749315,BriAltStation,16364888
After watching this @Mariners game now fully onboard with robot plate umpire. I've had enough. @colingawel @james_baumann @northcoastposse,1514016497475194889,BriAltStation,16364888
Suarez with his first M's dinger! @colingawel @northcoastposse @james_baumann,1513980145379516421,BriAltStation,16364888
Of course we get the Valesquez that throws strikes. Hopefully he'll turn back into himself soon.,1513979917649780758,BriAltStation,16364888
"Matt Brash MLB debut today vs ChiSox. 2k in the first. Scouts hate his across the body delivery, but there's no doubting that heater and the wipe out late breaking slider. #Mariners @colingawel @northcoastposse @james_baumann",1513979663877615623,BriAltStation,16364888
I say this with admiration. Luis Arraez of the @Twins is a pain in the ass. Elite contact skills. Rare these days.,1513677401917734921,BriAltStation,16364888

They need to calm down. Jesus. Every play someone is wearing a sport coat or beating their chest. Exhausting. https://t.co/HOLcWrpbUm,1512629239509569541,BriAltStation,16364888
Tonight's Rangers opener will be pretty much their season. Horrific pitching.,1512606633234415617,BriAltStation,16364888
