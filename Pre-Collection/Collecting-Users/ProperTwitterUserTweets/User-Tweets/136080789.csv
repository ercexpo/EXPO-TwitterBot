"Since a few folks have asked, here's how the end of tonight's game sounded on the @daytonatortugas Radio Network.

Not exactly how I hoped it would play out. 😅

"Entering my third season, it long overdue to meet the Srebnik’s in person!

Two of the many amazing fans among #TugaNation! So glad you were able to join me for a frame tonight! https://t.co/LsFzmJVXoh",1514756787198648327,JustinRocke,136080789
"Benschoter's day is done — as expected — after four, giving way to RHP José Franco.

That makes two Daytona starters — Benschoter and Julian Aguiar — who had perfect outings with 7 K's in their first starts within the initial 6 games of the year. https://t.co/vzleJw1HwI",1514748881808023560,JustinRocke,136080789
"Sam Benschoter through 4.0 innings tonight?

4.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 7 K on 50 pitches (32 strikes). 

He’s induced 12 swings-and-missed and 6-of-7 K’s have been on dropped-third strikes. 

Waited behind to dap up catcher Andruw Salcedo after the fourth. #RedsMiLB",1514747183412789251,JustinRocke,136080789
"If he's not your pregame guest tomorrow, I don't know what you're doing, Joe. https://t.co/IOQu5W3gs8",1514745123548151810,JustinRocke,136080789
"Sam Benschoter has picked up right where he left off at Roger Dean last summer.

The 24-year-old undrafted free-agent signee strikes out Palm Beach in order in the first on 13 pitches.

FB topped out at 94.6 mph in the first. #RedsMiLB",1514736365182857222,JustinRocke,136080789
"We have lineups for game three of this six-game set in Palm Beach.

Join us on the pregame show at 6:15 PM ET as we chat with last night’s starter @Tanner_Cooper2 about his 7-strikeout performance, his injury rehab, and more. First pitch at 6:30.

"Wait, @tomfunk03’s brother is transferring to Penn State?

As an alum and a @GoArmyWestPoint broadcaster, I am ecstatic to have Andrew in Happy Valley! https://t.co/bO7AgkbcFm",1514678977029361665,JustinRocke,136080789
