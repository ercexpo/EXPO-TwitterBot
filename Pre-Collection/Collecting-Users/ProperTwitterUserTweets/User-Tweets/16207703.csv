"MONSIEUR BEAUCAIRE (46) Foppish skewering of novel/1924 Valentino vehicle has barber in French Court of King Louis XV impersonating notorious ladies' man about to be married to Princess of Spain.Lengthy, overly silly Hope comedy has funny situations but doesn't know when to quit. https://t.co/j2PPbU5p05",1513758043682402305,Moonspinner55,16207703
"THE BUTTERCUP CHAIN (70) Cousins find romantic partners but are really in love w/each other. Book-adapt shrewd, frisky to start, flashy. Cast quite good apart from Hywel Bennett, acting crazy even tho his scenes don't always call for it (he's rather like the British Bruce Dern). https://t.co/le4XTp79o2",1513746227531190272,Moonspinner55,16207703

"Caveat emptor, Brady Bunch fans. This ""import"" CD (made in Switzerland!) is really just a cleverly-disguised bootleg. That said, had they included Maureen's solo cuts I would have bought it. @MoMcCormick7 https://t.co/Q03MZk6dTT",1513701209789853697,Moonspinner55,16207703
"DOGFIGHT (91) Marines in 63 compete to see who can get ugliest date; Phoenix manages to humiliate Taylor before ""finally seeing the human being underneath."" Critically-acclaimed drama an acting exercise--and that's all. A simplistic writer's conceit epitomized by baleful title. https://t.co/pL3vu1xOJE",1513691155807948804,Moonspinner55,16207703
"FAMILY: CHANGE OF HEART (TV-77) Nancy is jealous over her ex's new fianc√©e, a ski shop cashier (Veronica Hamel, looking like a million bucks--or, all the merchandise &amp; then some!); Buddy wants to be ""sexy"" like Liza for the school talent show. Terrific S3 ep. Tart, witty &amp; pithy. https://t.co/N0QlUhCkJk",1513665040972349440,Moonspinner55,16207703
