"Less judging each other, more working together on common goals. Let’s direct our frustrations and energy at solving the real problems: First Past The Post (FPTP) voting &amp; Closed Primaries. 

We do this by getting #RCV &amp; #OpenPrimaries on the ballot in as many states as we can. https://t.co/lZWoB8vVjT",1514862214099910667,washheights44,24306387
"Because picking the lesser of 2 evils over and over again is tearing us apart.

"My first ⚾️ @PrizePicks 5x5 hits— damn, it feels good. 

This intersection of ⚾️ &amp; playoff 🏀 is the best time of year. 

Pretty sure the #Dodgers are going to be a BIG crutch to lean on for player props this year.

@CoorsField is always fun too 👍 https://t.co/woi9nKKnuz",1514855530711429126,washheights44,24306387
"#YangGang stand-up comic @ilike2Mudit is performing this Saturday at 5pm! 

We @NewLeafDems @income_movement @mayorsforagi have a #UBI petitioning event Saturday morning in Sunnyside, then potentially the Mets game as a group, but maybe then also this? 🤔

"My childhood was blessed w/  the Yankees’ most recent dynasty (mid-late 90’s)

~1997 I began to call the Astros my “NL team”. The Bagwell &amp; Biggio era was peaking, &amp; I’d recently found out I had a sister in TX.

Nowadays the #Dodgers are my NL team. It’s ok bc they’re from NY 😀 https://t.co/UO4lf6Auwd",1514847483498835974,washheights44,24306387
"Thank you #Dodgers for the big 8th inning 🙏⚾️🔥

And thank you #NewYork for not being stuck in the stone age anymore with that old Puritan mindset still lingering in too many states (but thankfully fading away).

1 big problem w/trying to get to bed early is that the freaking DODGERS play the vast majority of their games until 1 am ET so…yea. If I can keep biphasic (in my case ~4.5 hours then another 3 in the late morning) I’ll prob keep doing that. As long as it makes sense to do so.,1514830318599081984,washheights44,24306387
