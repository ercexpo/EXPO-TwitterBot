New Orleans needs to beat the Clippers. Charlotte can figure out the tax implications of two first round picks later. #AllFly https://t.co/T2kLjy864N,1514633963154944006,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
Every starter outside of PJ Washington should be ashamed of how they played last night. Looked like the Summer League Hornets out there. https://t.co/3gcmSYOCOl,1514610165722476554,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
I would have behaved the same way if Charlotte won last night. https://t.co/ClxNqIfL59,1514609479601467395,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
"It is probably time to consider trading Terry Rozier. Getting him for Kemba was a great move, but Rozier hasn't shown the desire to take his game to the next level. He is the second highest paid player on the squad and he played like trash after the All Star break.",1514605035094614030,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
Being a @hornets fan is rough. I am getting cooked in all the sports groups where I am active because I was going super hard for Charlotte all season. I deserve it though. It is my fault for caring more about winning than the players. Them boys embarrassed themselves last night.,1514604288374321155,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
Melo played like an All Star most of the year and I really hope he keeps getting better. He definitely needs to stop settling for deep 3s and work on his on-ball defense. Teams led by superstars don't get eliminated on the play-in tournament. #AllFly,1514429901344018435,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
I also hope Mitch considers buying out Hayward's contract or stretching it like the Lakers did Deng's contract. Hayward is taking up too much cap space for someone who barely plays. #AllFly,1514429337864486917,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
"Since Bridges is an RFA, I hope Charlotte lets another team make the first offer. Can't see giving max deal to a guy who can't lead his team out of the play-in tournament. I would love to have him on the team, but not at max money. #AllFly",1514428751748214785,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
SMH. Embarrassing. Just as bad as the Pacers loss last year. I really hope Mitch and Jordan don't run the same team and coaching staff back. Something or things is missing. https://t.co/EFoIi2Zd6w,1514424686419054599,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
I have no idea why the rookies aren't playing. This game has been over for a while and outside of Washington the starters don't want to win tonight. Just play the young guys. They earned it. #AllFly,1514416936586813443,MayorTalib,848747252768231425
