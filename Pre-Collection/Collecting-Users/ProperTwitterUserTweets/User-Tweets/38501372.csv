"After consulting with my family, I have made the decision to declare for the NFL Draft.

My preference is to play in Cincinnati, however I would be happy to play anywhere that guarantees me the league minimum, pays a 7-figure signing bonus, &amp; waves the physical. #RuleTheJungle",1508561765797408768,Burnsid2,38501372

"I know Iâ€™m a rare combo Atlanta Braves &amp; Cincinnati Bengals fan, but this past year pro sports wise was outstanding. Iâ€™m not sweating any front office moves. Both are in good hands. #WhoDey #Braves #ForTheA #RuleTheJungle #FreddieFreeman #CollinsWatch #Bengals",1505571257726955521,Burnsid2,38501372

"Regardless of who @FreddieFreeman5 signs with, I love the @Braves &amp; the way he plays the game. Yes, I want him back in ATL, but I also know he has to do what he feels is best for him &amp; his family. I trust AA to make the right decisions. Go Braves Forever. #Braves",1503015850676215809,Burnsid2,38501372
