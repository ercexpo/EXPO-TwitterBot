"Yeah, that one was pretty obvious. I saw that live. Don’t know how the linesman didn’t. #GoBolts https://t.co/BaO0sG60ng",1514763286583119883,jcdelatorre,34116154
"I don’t know, think the Lightning were offsides on that goal. #GoBolts",1514762695236632582,jcdelatorre,34116154
"JFC. As good as the 1st period was, the 2nd period has been that terrible. 

3 deflection goals and bad defense and suddenly the Lightning are losing to a team that has won 2 games in their last 17. Vasy pulled. It wasn’t his fault. My gods. #GoBolts https://t.co/ZzyBN7SG3I",1514761563722465288,jcdelatorre,34116154
Good start for the #Bolts tonight. Hopefully they can sustain this effort for 3 periods. #GoBolts https://t.co/P33PLMTKXD,1514752684527702023,jcdelatorre,34116154
