"Look at that last stat. People simply do not appreciate what we’ve had in Vladi. Don’t get me wrong, he’s loved. But there isn’t enough appreciation for how hard he is to replace. He may not be Ovi or Crosby or Stamkos, but he’s still a rare breed of goal scorer. https://t.co/X1mQj8hi0f",1514841785394245635,jstriebel22,46180637

"Anybody know the latest on @byrdbarrelstl on Hampton? They ran into a pretty challenging time for moving and setting up a larger operation, so totally get it. But the longer these things take the more you worry they're just plain not gonna happen.",1514343762008461317,jstriebel22,46180637

"Cap tip to @DannyMacTV who nailed yet another call. Always does these moments justice. Someday a decade from now, I’ll watch this again and be able to feel exactly what I felt yesterday in large part because of that. https://t.co/0DfxqC6aA1",1514137991660326915,jstriebel22,46180637
"Had literally the exact same reaction as @DannyMacTV saying it basically simultaneously.

"Pro sports teams don’t need to be profitable.

I understand nobody wants to lose mass amounts of money. That’s perfectly fair. But they don’t need to be profitable. I’d actually go so far as to say they should *not* be profitable.",1514049566110363657,jstriebel22,46180637
"Would be great if Cabrera and Hicks (and ultimately Reyes when he’s healthy) could show improved control this season. Early results aren’t there, but huge emphasis on early.",1514048947890933763,jstriebel22,46180637
"I’m not surprised the Blues took a penalty on that shift, but the call (and what they aren’t calling) is pretty garbage",1514038076955410442,jstriebel22,46180637
