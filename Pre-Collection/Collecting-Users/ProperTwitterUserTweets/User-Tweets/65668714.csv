"So now on should be the 8th act, and  Key One Star (can’t find the twitter) is another victim of the bad mix from who is running the sound board at #AmericanSongContest  could barely hear her over the music and sounds like she wasn’t getting the sound from monitors or earpiece",1506100574638551042,DannyUsesWords,65668714
"Now watching @JakeOmusic on #AmericanSongContest  and just getting wannabe Elvis vibes, nothing original……",1506099276321116163,DannyUsesWords,65668714

"On the 5th act of #AmericanSongContest  and Christian Pagan is killing it (can’t find his twitter so if you know please tag him) song is great, stage presence is great, and we all just enjoyed it.",1506095599183085578,DannyUsesWords,65668714
