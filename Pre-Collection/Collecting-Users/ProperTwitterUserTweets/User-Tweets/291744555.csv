"800 hours. EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS!! Holy carpüêü

They had 12 to 14-hour days for 30 seconds of usable footage. I get that it was all practical effects‚Äîno CGI, but, YIKES!

I cannot begin to fathom the TRUE production budget for this film. It's listed as $152M. I don't believe itü§• https://t.co/vxtk6WEV3e https://t.co/Rmok30Zv4Y",1514768285220237316,MBrumagin,291744555

"If we're going strictly off the film adaptations of these characters, I guess I'd take Doctor Strange and Flash.

If we're going off of all variants (comics, TV, film)‚Ä¶ Give me Old King Thor with the Phoenix Force and Strange Supreme. https://t.co/IqeVqLYuC6",1514289233598554112,MBrumagin,291744555
"+15,000 odds for LeBron as HC is kind of hilarious to me. I can see him coaching one day, but he's still very active off the court. Don't think he wants that HC stress right now.

Nick Nurse is my top pick, but it'd be a wasted hire if they don't fix the front office. https://t.co/6XShZFbBh8",1514286157290524676,MBrumagin,291744555
"I think it is tragic that LeBron's greatness/legacy is being tarnished by Skip Bayless' negative takes having shaped the media landscape. Skip made hating LeBron a ratings cash-grab for any-and-all takers.

Kudos to Skip for starting a media trend.
LeBron deserves better, though.",1514277837246812169,MBrumagin,291744555
"My friend, @sherwood008, is launching a book. ""ONE"", a deep dive into making disciples [Matt. 28:18-20].

This is an essential topic, and I know he has a lot of wisdom, expertise, and experience to share in writing about it.

"I still don't trust them to win it all.

In a vacuum, based on talent and chemistry, it should be their title to lose, hands down.

I'm hesitant because it always seems, as unfair as it is, that anytime Chris Paul is close to contending, injuries derail his team. (Knock on wood) https://t.co/EZgxJrD1qU",1513233213434515457,MBrumagin,291744555
"I like @mikethemiz ... because I DON'T like him.

He does his job EXTREMELY well. His job is to make people not like him. He is a heel. A dang good one. If you don't like him, he's doing his job‚Äîwhether you know it or not.

He deserves far more respect than he has been given.",1512832077309300743,MBrumagin,291744555
"The @NBA has a referee problem.

The refs are both soft and bad. I understand it's a difficult job with a lot to keep up with in a fast-paced game, yada, yada.

But, Brothers admitted there was no profanity. He just T'd Luka up because he continued complaining about the non-call. https://t.co/KUB86ebuAH",1512814622868484098,MBrumagin,291744555
"Why is everyone scoffing at the Hornets potentially wanting to trade for Westbrook? I'd like to assume they know he would not fit alongside LaMelo Ball‚Äîboth need the ball in their hands.

So, either Russ would be accepting a bench role, or...

The plan is to buy him out.",1512808046749175811,MBrumagin,291744555
