"no no no no no.

"if iâ€™m the hornets, itâ€™s time to move on from borrego. not a bad coach whatsoever but two straight years you lose in the play in game. they also need to get a legitimate pnr threat/rim protector big. gotta move on from hayward and get another shooter in his place.",1514460381749653504,CamDancy,739823798
