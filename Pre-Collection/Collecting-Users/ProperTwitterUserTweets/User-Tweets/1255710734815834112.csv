And the Draisaitl hatty on the powerplay makes it 4-0. Game over. Time to enjoy the rest of my night #Preds,1514792104605609985,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
This one is definitely coming back #Preds,1514788830301212675,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
"We finally break through for a goal, as Sissons gets down low and tips it in. #Preds down 3-1 but another challenge is incoming……..",1514788713762418698,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
"How Duchene didn’t score that I don’t know, but good to see Fil Joey and Duchene are back together #Preds",1514786965949886475,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
"So I thought we could get it together this period? Ah, foolish optimism. For all the “pressure” we got, they certainly seemed to have no trouble turning us away. Then when we got those goals against we never responded. Just awful #Preds",1514782096773955588,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
"Fil has gone 5 games without a goal, I don’t see how you can argue against putting him back with Duchene #Preds",1514781448485568519,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
Too bad Fil didn’t bury that beautiful move #Preds,1514780214106066947,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
Another lapse in defense again. I can hardly even suffer through the pain anymore. #Preds down 3-0,1514779576030806022,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
McDavid doesn’t handle his frustrations well #Preds,1514779081547546628,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
Nice entry by Zach Hyman who finds Leon Draisaitl wide open in front. You just can’t let that happen. #Preds down 2-0,1514777588350087176,MaxGreenberg176,1255710734815834112
