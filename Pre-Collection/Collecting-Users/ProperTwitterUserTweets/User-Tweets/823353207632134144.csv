"Former top #Yankees prospect Manny Banuelos was phenomenal for them tn

3 IP, 0 R, 2 H, 3 SO, 0 BB, 33 P

Of the 8 balls put in play, none had an exit velocity over 80 mph and a positive launch angle (all hard hit balls were on the ground).

Could be real SP depth/bullpen piece",1509352299096911876,GhostofGeorgeNY,823353207632134144
