Lmaooo the 16 year olds still think Gallo is good.,1514795622674575372,SteveTheScholar,604018882
I was actually angry when the Yankees traded for Gallo last year. This is why. He SUCKS. He is not good.,1514795351114280967,SteveTheScholar,604018882
Two runners on and Gallo up? I’ll go use the bathroom. Maybe he’ll have another “unlucky” strikeout this time up!,1514794247764918280,SteveTheScholar,604018882
This offense is awful. They might be worse than last year,1514793080603381763,SteveTheScholar,604018882
Josh Donaldson SUCKS. This is moron Cashman’s big off-season acquisition hahaha,1514788447826808849,SteveTheScholar,604018882
Jose Trevino is our best hitter now?!,1514787563021619200,SteveTheScholar,604018882
Yankees pitching is elite. It’s a shame the offense is dog shit,1514786764853899283,SteveTheScholar,604018882
