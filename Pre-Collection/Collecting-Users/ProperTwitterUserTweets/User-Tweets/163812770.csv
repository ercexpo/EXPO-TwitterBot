I’d move Schwarber down to 5th and see what happens. Vierling being awful is a bummer. Thought he could develop into a leadoff guy.,1514790749505679362,mdschaeff,163812770
Have to move him down in the order. Problem is they don’t have a leadoff hitter.,1514787030475059212,mdschaeff,163812770
Corral got a draft invite? Surprised he’s going first round but congrats to the Falcons.,1514778104102735873,mdschaeff,163812770
Schwarber is not a leadoff hitter. Guy stinks.,1514774212673617920,mdschaeff,163812770
Before the season everyone said they would have to win a lot of games 12-8 or something. Not sure why anyone is truly down on them. They’ll be fine once the bats wake up.,1514767281057894402,mdschaeff,163812770
