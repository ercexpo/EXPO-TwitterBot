"April hasn’t started how I wanted it to, -10U. Luckily we’re still up 86U on the year but I’m also aware that not everyone has been tailing since January 1st.

Let’s turn it around starting with this free max tomorrow and profit in April!

Throw a ❤️ if you’re riding with me🏄🏽‍♂️",1514802699610382342,CaribbeanCapper,1139363022869344256

Got 20 cents of value on this and then Ohtani of all people goes out and gives up the second most ER’s of his entire career. Love to see it.

Oh yeah, we were also on the Angels when Ohtani gave up the most ER’s of his career. They ended up winning that one though👀😂 https://t.co/SS2dNeMr8l",1514784736295587840,CaribbeanCapper,1139363022869344256
