Surprised that IKF hit wasn’t caught,1514776660184240139,Jeffrey50652675,1073070960205541376
Completely agree with @Rosenbergradio on his Yankee opening home stand take. Any reasonable yankee fan would agree. Couldn’t be more accurate,1514682288893829133,Jeffrey50652675,1073070960205541376
Vlad beat us tonight. Let’s work around him tomorrow and split the series. #repbx,1514428307676270592,Jeffrey50652675,1073070960205541376
