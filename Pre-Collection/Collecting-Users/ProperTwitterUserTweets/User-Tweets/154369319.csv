"I like this for @derekcarrqb...he's capable of winning at high-level. Smart move by the @Raiders to ""IGNORE THE NONSENSE"" keepling a very good QB in the fold. There's a reason why MANY teams are looking for a QB...they are HARD TO FIND. #LVR #Raiders #NFL

Love this for my guy @Anthony_Becht!  Hell of a #football mind. Players will be BETTER from playing for him. https://t.co/FQ7X6aQReM,1514260271853883395,RWalk13,154369319
"My post-ESPN journey began -- in theory -- on this day 5 years ago! I had never PLANNED to leave, but sometimes we are forced to PIVOT! Since then, I've  landed a great NEXT ACT here @sbjsbd. In addition, catch me in a #CFB booth near you this fall.

"Out in NYC on business, including working the @WNBA draft (a very nice event by the way) and I see the homie @SHARPEST_EYE getting ready to do his thing on the @espn broadcast. Always good to see the baddest steadicam man in the land. #WWL #respect https://t.co/KR1LWeptCL",1514216308631552010,RWalk13,154369319

"I completely agree that there are TOO MANY belts in #boxing. This is why we don't get the BIGGEST AND BEST fights all the time. Different ""mandatory"" challengers for so many belts. It's annoying sometimes. @ESPNRingside @BoxingKingdom14 https://t.co/ZtDL9DWusY",1513907039025745926,RWalk13,154369319
