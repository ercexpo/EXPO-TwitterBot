Love it.  Good for him. https://t.co/RP3r7oYB9Z,1514697108787326977,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
Now my friend that is a #Raider fan doesn't think Rob Walton possibly owning the Broncos matters at all. He truly thinks that adding a guy that is more than four times wealthier than the next closest owner doesn't make much of an impact on anything. #RaiderNation really is dense.,1514672322103308292,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
Empower Field at Walmart Mile High coming soon to #BroncosCountry https://t.co/6AulwQJ1Bm,1514651995914706966,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
Relying on Chubb and Gregory to stay healthy and to reach their potential. That’s why I want Paton to add more pass rushers in FA and the draft. https://t.co/krrzU7EtBc,1514635286579273732,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
"#BroncosCountry, my son got me onto this and I love it.  If you like the #NFL and currently play Wordle, then you’ll enjoy this too.  https://t.co/xbB63L2fjQ",1514470161054457857,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
He must have quite the playoff resume then #RaidersNation https://t.co/tBnou47ckT,1514368280504389632,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
I could care less.  The #Raiders had to pay him because they couldn't go from fourth-best QB in the division to something less than that.  This was their only option. https://t.co/hddG5GqsHR,1514307699189551110,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
#BroncosCountry what fan base is weakest at trash talk and why is it #RaiderNation?,1513890328318812163,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
"We always admit he’s underperformed, but there’s also context to everything. I’m sure by your strong opinion you watched every Bronco game you know about Jeudy’s ankle that nearly broke and how he still wasn’t 100% when he came back, and you saw how he was used by his coordinator https://t.co/h0ZcKY2K4A",1513586722356940803,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
"Oh boy, Raiderette fan wants to bag on Jerry Jeudy.  Please tell me more about Henry Ruggs and his ""future"" in the league. Jeudy's career is about to take off and I'll be watching him 10 years from now.  And you'll soon be looking for another WR when Adams $$ really starts in. https://t.co/KMwQPydRPs",1513565471953625095,PolishFilipino,1152278308798644224
