"Iâ€™m telling you guys, championship hangover and Braves have got to work their way through it. Thereâ€™s a reason itâ€™s so hard to repeat in major sports. #ForTheA",1514767591637667840,AustinPlanet,1036468166250123265
I fully believe in championship hangovers and I think itâ€™s something the Braves are dealing with. I think/hope theyâ€™ll eventually get out of it but itâ€™s a real thing. AcuÃ±a coming back should give them a huge boost. #ForTheA,1514765983038255107,AustinPlanet,1036468166250123265

DC finding another Kevin Feige is going to be hard. He studied filmmaking at USC and learned under X-Men producer Lauren Shuler Donner while also being a huge comic book fan. Nobody knows the source material better than him. Good luck to WB on finding that.,1514711515240222729,AustinPlanet,1036468166250123265

"The #ThisIsUs flash forwards are brutal man, weâ€™ve spent 6 years with these characters and seeing their past/present/future is gut wrenching. Every episode of this final season has been great.",1514061110084784130,AustinPlanet,1036468166250123265
