The Packers just officially signed Sammy Watkins and he’s going to wear No. 11 — or the same number Devin Funchess wore when they signed him almost exactly two years ago. https://t.co/B9S5dfhi6F,1514696865593266177,itszacharyj,1267687247542996992
So Focused on Pro Football and still so remarkably clueless https://t.co/qRDD7KUpSj,1514680682336829475,itszacharyj,1267687247542996992
It shouldn’t. Sammy Watkins is a placeholder that takes a little bit of the burden off of the shoulders of any rookies they bring in. He’s not dependable until proven otherwise. I still think the Packers need at least two pass-catchers in the top-100. https://t.co/3SbWLdeODm,1514677057074053132,itszacharyj,1267687247542996992

"I, too, am at the Applebee’s here in Green Bay and Jordy Nelson just showed up https://t.co/EGnxlRpAwl",1514663151916097541,itszacharyj,1267687247542996992
"Bringing in Sammy Watkins really wouldn’t be a big deal — unless he makes it one. It’d be an extremely low-cost move for a veteran with a shaky injury history. If he can stay healthy, he can immediately become the Packers’ No. 2 and take a ton of burden off an incoming rookie(s).",1514635662238048257,itszacharyj,1267687247542996992
I’m never questioning the unbridled power of Redditors again https://t.co/wksFHKgKvr,1514632542854402048,itszacharyj,1267687247542996992
Oh wow just caught sight of Jordy Nelson at the local Green Bay airport https://t.co/QvWK8FaHXu,1514628865393455105,itszacharyj,1267687247542996992
"Several. Drake London, Chris Olave, George Pickens, Christian Watson, John Metchie and Alec Pierce are all favorites that feel like strong Packers fits. I’m not super locked into Tyquan Thornton, but same can be said for him. https://t.co/2BJfDDYtoq",1514604587876904965,itszacharyj,1267687247542996992
