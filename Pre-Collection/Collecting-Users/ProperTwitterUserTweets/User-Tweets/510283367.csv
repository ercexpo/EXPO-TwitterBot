"This poll is an interesting study on the bias of a fanbase.

Bengals &amp; Browns are making moves to win a SB tomorrow. The Ravens have their star QB and are building around him.

"Georgetown law student and sports fan here. Happy to help.

Though from the same incidents, Watson is facing 2 legal issues: 1) a criminal suit, to be potentially brought against him by the state where he committed the wrongdoing which, when most severe, can land him in jail; 1/ https://t.co/3aaTARgze3 https://t.co/EAJLwzHA7i",1501313123965407239,Elliot_Fuchs,510283367
The fact that the @Steelers pursued 38 year old @AaronRodgers12 but not 33 year old @DangeRussWilson makes me very nervous about the competence of the front office. #Steelers #AaronRodgers #RussellWilson #NFL,1501270671615213569,Elliot_Fuchs,510283367
