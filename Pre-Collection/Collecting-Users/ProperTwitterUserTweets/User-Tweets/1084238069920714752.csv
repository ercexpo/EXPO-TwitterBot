Packers have had a good offseason. Kept intact a defense with FOUR all pros on it. Lost Davante which sucks but got cap space and draft capital. Added players in free agency. Keep in mind people thought the team was going to be gutted and hasn't been the case,1514741742452367361,CarlosS29143608,1084238069920714752
With the draft approaching these three players will affect how the Packers draft this year https://t.co/Ee3p12JjZm,1514700496023425045,CarlosS29143608,1084238069920714752

Still need to address wide receiver in the draft hopefully,1514682759448444943,CarlosS29143608,1084238069920714752
If we can get this and he stays healthy we are good https://t.co/0VLXr2SG72,1514661217503092746,CarlosS29143608,1084238069920714752
If we sign Sammy Watkins it will be a Rick Wagner type signing he is above average at best but will contribute to the team https://t.co/iXlJ5zsdl7,1514654308498743321,CarlosS29143608,1084238069920714752

"When it comes to the Packers draft most of it is going to come down to this
•Do the Packers have faith in Darnell Savage to not draft a safety early.
•Is Krys Barnes the guy next to DeVondre Campbell
•Can Yosh Ninjman play right tackle",1514438581774737411,CarlosS29143608,1084238069920714752
Again I feel where Baker is coming from no he isn’t all great at qb but does have a point https://t.co/GRJDt6li9l,1514279107328053249,CarlosS29143608,1084238069920714752
I get Baker here hell Aaron Rodgers never have to deal with multiple different head coaches in his career. Baker did have to deal with idk how many coordinators tooo in how many years. Is all good no but the Browns should have done better by him https://t.co/cuKvmNG2sK,1514278535333965829,CarlosS29143608,1084238069920714752
