"Hey @Marlins, the @BlueJays are making a hard play for my fandom. You got anything to say about it? 

Really considering going #NextLevel and heading to Toronto with @VladdyJr_27 and @GeorgeSpringer

I’ve heard from a lot of y’all and now is the time to decide. Do I stay or do I go.

"#MLBTwitter 

Okay, so I’ve been a @Marlins fan but with them not EVER wanting to spend to keep any notable players…

My fandom is now a FA.  Lol. These are who I’m considering. I might stay with Miami also. Tell me comments if you got different.

"So #ColtsNation 

I’m considering getting another @Colts jersey. So far I have @M_Ryan02 and @dsleon45 jerseys. 

Who should I get next?

This paired with the Watts signing makes me think that Ballard is moving on from Matheiu and is tired of waiting.  It wouldn't shock me to see some possible WR signing next as they potentially move on from Landry as well. https://t.co/6YjjGOWpCn,1512523372525232133,StephenBurton86,219012445
Does anyone else think that at this point that the Saints may not want him??? https://t.co/AnF3RB9600,1511794643708567555,StephenBurton86,219012445
