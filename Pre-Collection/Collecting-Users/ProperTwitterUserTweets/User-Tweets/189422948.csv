Garrett cole is average post sticky stuff. Nobody could say otherwise,1514393047538319370,jfranco044,189422948
"Hey #knicks fans, don’t miss out! Read this https://t.co/lFWC4e0piM",1513652504973692938,jfranco044,189422948
That is a joke of a call ump #yankees,1513326823677079553,jfranco044,189422948
Aaron Hicks having the game from hell #yankees,1513326036624285702,jfranco044,189422948
Anthony Rizzo is a pleasure to watch #yankees,1513320589565612043,jfranco044,189422948
I’m sorry but IKF has not impressed at all at shortstop in these first two games #yankees,1512928988003454980,jfranco044,189422948
Is that Marinaccio or Ottavino?!? #yankees,1512903722535464970,jfranco044,189422948
I’ve never understood why the #yankees ever bring Chad Green in directly after Cole. He’s the same style just worse,1512499349825146886,jfranco044,189422948
It’s amazing how Stanton has changed the minds of all #yankees fans with his play. He absolutely rakes,1512496000740511746,jfranco044,189422948
Through 3 innings it’s already clear how much better the #yankees infield defense is. Arguably 3 plays they wouldn’t have made last season,1512490602386046981,jfranco044,189422948
