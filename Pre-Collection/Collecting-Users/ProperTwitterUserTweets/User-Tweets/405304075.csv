A couple of familiar opponents but a good schedule with teams SHS hasn’t seen in a while. https://t.co/6pctUQfBDW,1512453338109034500,ChrisWCox17,405304075
"Wimbledon with Beckham. 
1) Its maybe the most historic tournament in all sports. 
2) Great seats. 
3) You’d likely sit next to literal royalty &amp; other really famous people. 
4) It’s a sport where you can’t talk during the action. Tennis is an introvert’s sport. 
5) Fun accents. https://t.co/9OjdK3AKJj",1512218712467820547,ChrisWCox17,405304075
This is one of those plays that’s iffy. Middleton appears to be making a play on the ball but he’s way behind the play &amp; Brown was in the air. Maybe a flagrant 1 but I don’t think he should’ve been ejected. https://t.co/wOkQb102Fy,1509707634844344324,ChrisWCox17,405304075
"I mean, yeah, his jersey should get retired in OKC but you can’t say it. Also, would it be that bad for the game if they didn’t? https://t.co/9pokq3QekJ",1509689792770064394,ChrisWCox17,405304075

Congrats Deshawn Munson! It’s a blast covering you and watching you take over games. Dude is unstoppable driving to the basket. https://t.co/uYxAgrPiB9,1506961342783266816,ChrisWCox17,405304075
"Tyreek Hill is very, very good. But I’m not trading 5 picks for him, or any WR. This years draft class is fast and deep. But I guess Miami feels (rightfully so) that they’ll have to score a bunch of points to win games in the AFC East.",1506675714770325521,ChrisWCox17,405304075
So the Miami Dolphins are just gonna go run past everyone aren’t they? That’s a TON of speed on that roster. https://t.co/7jIIb9Ghh3,1506674289394823173,ChrisWCox17,405304075
