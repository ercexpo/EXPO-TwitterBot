What a 24 hours this has been! From being as happy as I’ve ever been walking out of the stadium last night to what has now happened today on twitter. I’m so glad to be a Panthers fan. Thank you so much @goldieonice @Dougielarge! Time to ask her sometime this week I guess https://t.co/g0vietTj0U,1514310912089497603,miamiguydylan,3079953863
"I need some help @goldieonice. I want to ask this one girl to Prom and she’s a big Panthers fan. Is there anyway I could get a video of instead of saying “let’s go home baby”, you say “let’s go to prom baby.” It would mean a lot. Her name is Marisa",1514295860498161674,miamiguydylan,3079953863
