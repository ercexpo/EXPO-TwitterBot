"I still have some tickets left for tomorrowâ€™s #Dodgers home opener. I have my regular seats (field level section 43 row E) and some in the left-field pavilion (section 305 row Q). Not cheap, but quite a bit less than youâ€™d pay elsewhere. DM me if interested.",1514410876215853060,snidog,14097586
Spring baseball in Utah is always interesting. https://t.co/vU7IYwauki,1514368207238283267,snidog,14097586
Dave Roberts never played the game. Sad. https://t.co/GudcsslJLb,1514346410207940608,snidog,14097586
The Dodgers' home opener is in a little over a day and I still haven't decided for sure whether I'm going. Stupid gas prices. ðŸ˜‚,1514346227466264577,snidog,14097586
"The question was never ""Can Kersh keep going?"" It was always ""Do we (Dave Roberts and Clayton Kershaw) think there's any realistic chance Kersh can go two more innings?"" And if the answer to that is no -- which it obviously was -- then there's no reason not to pull him after 7.",1514325872097968128,snidog,14097586
Dave Roberts is taking Clayton Kershaw out because he knows my wife doesn't want to spend 11 months on another cross-stitch. https://t.co/Q80Nk77fEb,1514321250801258496,snidog,14097586
Kershaw is just walking around the dugout talking to people.,1514316523032113152,snidog,14097586
Kersh loves Jumbo Jacks.,1514314499834081281,snidog,14097586
Kershaw has allowed more balls in play than innings pitched (6 to 5). #FAIL,1514311743068987392,snidog,14097586
Sanchez was very clearly blocking the entire plate long before he got the ball on that play at home. I'm surprised the Dodgers didn't challenge it.,1514310105684078598,snidog,14097586
