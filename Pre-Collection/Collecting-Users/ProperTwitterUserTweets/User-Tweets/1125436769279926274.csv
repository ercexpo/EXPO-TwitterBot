"It seems the #Angels out there in Anaheim always has entertaining players, but they never seem to be that good",1510980335294730242,BrandonFromGA,1125436769279926274
No one in particular. Just logic. https://t.co/yMFan6Jehn,1510616904502808584,BrandonFromGA,1125436769279926274
"We would've had a better shot with him in a suspect division, particularly this season. This is just awful timing by Fontenot. If you weren't going to trade Ryan coming in, then he should've rode him out this year as opposed to a year later for a mere 3rd rounder. https://t.co/9ZYEr8MaH0",1506337000126922754,BrandonFromGA,1125436769279926274
With this roster I’d rather completely “tank” this year and get a top 5 pick next year with a better QB class. We should draft in many other areas this draft https://t.co/Fra5qX43A2,1506333314541662210,BrandonFromGA,1125436769279926274
It’s debatable. If the man you stan so much can draft worth a  fuck then yeah there was a pretty solid shot. Y’all act like QBs don’t play up to 40 these days. There was definitely another window but now you’re going to learn with the revolving door of QBs. https://t.co/EFNSU73PCH,1506307999043928071,BrandonFromGA,1125436769279926274
"You underrate how difficult it is to find another QB even if the team is stacked. It’ll be the the reverse situation that we had. 

So you think the Bears and Texans along with the falcons there are all on their way to greatness? Think for yourself. https://t.co/p6FUQDmUdE",1506306884416020487,BrandonFromGA,1125436769279926274
