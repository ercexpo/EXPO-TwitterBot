"""I would love to comeback for sure. I'll let my agent worry about that. Any questions on that, you gotta hit up Rich Paul.

I would love to play with Melo and Terry for the rest of my career. We all damn near averaged 20 this season.""

It was a tough game last night. https://t.co/gFccfYXsXA,1514631813280550915,JerryDonatien,906151195143798784
"Final: #Hawks 132, #Hornets 103

Ball: 26 pts, 5 reb, 7 ast
Rozier: 21 pts, 4 reb

The #Hornets  were never really able to make this one competitive. Still, this was an improved season on their part. Just gotta get back to the drawing board.

"Barring no major comeback, this would be two straight years the Hornets got blown out in the Play-In game as a 10-seed.

Lots of things to address in the offseason. A rim protector, coaching change possibly, Bridges contract, and soo much more.",1514408434438971398,JerryDonatien,906151195143798784
"Iâ€™ll go out on a limb here and say this one is over. The Hornets look terrible on both sides of the ball.

Itâ€™s really bad defensively though.",1514406235524767745,JerryDonatien,906151195143798784

Just need to get stops primarily though. Donâ€™t worry about the offense right now.",1514396368848236545,JerryDonatien,906151195143798784
