"ðŸ”¸ Knicks Twitter Appreciation ðŸ”¹

Been a ride this szn for sure. Didnâ€™t go how we expected but, I feel the community grew a bit closer (for the most part) &amp; that, to me is dope &amp; what itâ€™s all about

If youâ€™re apart of this community - 
I salute you! #NewYorkForever",1513997985977446402,dan_ny_b,23305448
