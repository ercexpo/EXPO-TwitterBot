"Since returning, Norman Powell has scored 37 points on 12 of 15 shooting in the first half of the three games he's played. But he's only scored 23 points on 5 of 16 shooting in the second half. Fatigue has seemed to be an issue, something Tyronn Lue mentioned at practice today.",1514727349022994432,FlyByKnite,42176777
Definitely a great series to help people understand just how much goes into a game day for players. Everyone should give all three episodes a watch. https://t.co/mMxIbymJ9i,1514477498603474950,FlyByKnite,42176777

"I see Bill Kennedy is working Pelicans-Spurs tonight, so there goes my dream of hearing a Bill Kennedy replay review ruling in person on Friday.",1514419632282619904,FlyByKnite,42176777
"I’m still in awe of Nick Wright saying, “Why aren’t we talking about Jaylen Brown?!” Only to then not talk about Jaylen Brown and instead choosing to attempt a weird tear down of Patrick Beverley. He looks like JP from “Grandma’s Boy” and acts like him too.",1514356332798918669,FlyByKnite,42176777
"Clayton Kershaw has thrown 100+ pitches just four times in his last 37 starts. It was going to take 100+ pitches today to get a perfect game. I dunno. It would have been awesome to see history, but, like, I get it.",1514326556520288258,FlyByKnite,42176777
"My big take on the Clayton Kershaw thing is that I love seeing history happen, and it would have been awesome. But also I understand how limited spring training was for pitchers, and Kershaw's pitch counts the last year or so have been kept down for the most part. It's fine.",1514324989238923265,FlyByKnite,42176777
