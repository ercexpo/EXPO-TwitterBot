"The results were less than ideal, but Nick Lodolo’s pitch quality metrics graded out incredibly from yesterday’s game.

By @enosarris’s Model: 119.4 Stuff+

By @Pitching_Bot’s: 65/80 Stuff

Based on Lodolo’s MiLB track record, I’ll optimistically say his Command will improve. https://t.co/jgdPTE1Wo2",1514686623186923520,RedsInFour,1279173924048306176

"I’m reading this as an attempt to get the Dodgers’ vRHP lineup to start the game and then place Reiver in for the bulk amount of innings.
