Not a surprise Luka isn’t playing in Game 1 but what is alarming is him being ruled out 48 hours before the playoffs even begin,1514681692103098370,PeasRadio,590425383
Yet another black eye for baseball pulling a guy throwing a perfect game and taking him out after 80 pitches. I know why they did it but it sure as hell doesn’t help out the sport,1514324416271945734,PeasRadio,590425383
2 of the first 3 Mavs playoff games are on NBATV which is bad news for streamers as they’ll be blacked out here. Imagine having playoff games blacked out forcing you to watch them on a channel you can’t get. Awful https://t.co/PPF9CRdzvJ,1514215711622709251,PeasRadio,590425383
That’s a gutsy win from Minnesota tonight and that was a playoff crowd as well,1514098137681600513,PeasRadio,590425383

"Mavs wrap up the regular season with their 5th straight win beating the Spurs 130-120.  Luka led the way with 26pts, 8 rebs and 9 assists before injuring his calf.  Dallas wraps up the regular season 52-30 and will host Game 1 against the Jazz either Saturday or Sunday",1513362401927720961,PeasRadio,590425383
Good insight here on if the Mavs will start either Saturday or Sunday. I suppose the Mavs could still potentially play an afternoon game and then move the Stars start time back https://t.co/hfms26uf8G,1513360846176636931,PeasRadio,590425383
