"It’s wild how so many people don’t have any idea what the 1A protects and yet they’ll cite it all the time to be a jerk. Side note, generally, they also have no idea the history of the 2A prior to Heller or the restrictions in it but that’s a totally different conversation. 😅 https://t.co/IqXjigXiFW",1514660046063423494,NiceReedSteve,565896966
"Dan Snyder basically sold his cheerleaders’ time/bodies to his wealthy friends at destination photo shoots? That’s not enough.
Dan Snyder has a history of discrimination against women and minorities? That’s not enough.
Dan Snyder stole money from the other owners? https://t.co/DzRDQIJ7pg https://t.co/W3yB6V8MH5",1513926096269492232,NiceReedSteve,565896966
Maybe a Reagor for Banogu swap? It’d make sense for both teams if Philly really is done with Raegor. https://t.co/Y1Kw9HBTYs,1513560774282817538,NiceReedSteve,565896966
The #Pacers have shown no interest in an aging veteran who looks to have lost it. #Lakers executives trying to will this into existence in hopes that the Pacers might think about it. They shouldn’t and they most likely won’t. https://t.co/JZjJN87Q1R,1513559802261159940,NiceReedSteve,565896966
"Amen. Been saying this for literally years.

"I’d love for them to win this last game. They’re already locked into their lottery odds and it would give CLE a better shot to make the 7/8 play in game, https://t.co/R5H2P97e5i",1512880374602477571,NiceReedSteve,565896966
"This you? So if Rock is a “bum” as you describe him, then why are you complaining and saying they created another hole. 🤷‍♂️😬

"So your position is people should only listen to someone on a topic is if that person has done that job? So you’ll be staying quiet on all personnel moves b/c you’ve never been an NFL GM? If nothing else, you’re saying no one should listen to you, which we both agree on. 🤷‍♂️😉 https://t.co/21fFOBH1MX",1512059291167039490,NiceReedSteve,565896966
"Tell me you haven’t watched Matt Ryan’s 2021 tape without telling me you haven’t watched Matt Ryan’s 2021 tape. 🤣🤣

Yannick concern is fair but he’s 26 and had at least 8 sacks every season with 10 last year.

Rock was solid last year but the cover 3 is a different defense. https://t.co/G1Xmh8CTdR",1511904181438885895,NiceReedSteve,565896966
It’s really wild how some #Colts fans view Chris Ballard versus how literally everyone else in the NFL views him. The contrast is so stark. You’re placing the same value on CB and DE. CB isn’t as critical a position in a Cover 3 and can be filled cheap if pass rusher is solved. https://t.co/aI875mB1Vn,1511740793362468873,NiceReedSteve,565896966
