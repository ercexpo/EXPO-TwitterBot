"With Logan Hall visiting today don’t overlook how much 5 man front they play. 

There’s 500-700 snaps there for a pass rushing 3T. 

Could really consider him a starter.",1514989553744068614,DavidNSimone,97343879

"Bengals off season offensive line thought of the day. 

I don’t believe Linderbaum will be available at pick 31. 

I also don’t believe if he is available the Bengals will select him. 

Have committed a ton of resources to OL last 2 years, feels like defensive pick in 1st.",1514288219923394565,DavidNSimone,97343879
