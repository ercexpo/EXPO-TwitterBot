"What this game taught me is that some teams only play a half and they think they won, while other teams step on the gas pedal and don’t give up till the end of the game https://t.co/fqx4tdbd9y",1511425871185211396,34therealdeal8,1080833772201828352
Looks good @Bwagz 👀 love you in the new blue and yellow💪🏻 https://t.co/l4DC1OdXXF,1511090515747377156,34therealdeal8,1080833772201828352
I wouldn’t be mad if the @Seahawks drafted @iamSauceGardner he’s a lockdown corner and we might need a little more help in the CB position https://t.co/Y6IrIh5EC1,1511051525908426757,34therealdeal8,1080833772201828352
The @Seahawks really need to bring these jerseys back with the @Eagles announcing that they’re bringing back their throwbacks in 2023. These jerseys were elite and I want to see them on the @Seahawks field again. 💙💚 https://t.co/AVKVd6DtrA,1509929255102083080,34therealdeal8,1080833772201828352
Congrats @Bwagz for a 5-year $50M deal with the @RamsNFL it’s gonna be hard seeing you in a different jersey but hope your career skyrockets in LA. As a @Seahawks fan thank you @Bwagz for a decade of being with the @Seahawks and thank you for the SuperBowl XLVIII win. https://t.co/YtkQKGbhY9,1509640716082823176,34therealdeal8,1080833772201828352
