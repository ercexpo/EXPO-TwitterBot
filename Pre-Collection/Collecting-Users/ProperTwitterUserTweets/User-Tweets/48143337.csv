"no dumber half-measure than divorcing the draft from record/performance unless you just flat out like market-suppression &amp; anti-competitive labor practices. what the NBA (and soon NFL) has done is bad enough, but they can't do more and keep up the charade; either have it or don't",1514711006127312902,makjak,48143337
goes without saying baseball is a bit different in that regard but in the NBA especially it is at worst a viable strategy. sorry,1514703461237071883,makjak,48143337
