"If you’re a big fan of @kiss and @RockAndBrews check out the grand opening of #RockNBrewsCasinoBraman in Braman, OK as the powerful &amp; legendary @genesimmons @PaulStanleyLive will be making an appearance on May 10th.  I’m so pumped!!! https://t.co/xtY0adW6he",1513684603738931203,TheWilliamRamos,2390435473
"If you like overpriced Mexican food w/poor quality then your place is @Tacos4LifeGrill in Bixby, OK. I don’t know how this place stays open as the last two times have been horrific. Their chicken quesadillas are overfilled with chicken &amp; cheese. 60 bucks down the drain. https://t.co/mWnZ6yBKgB",1513677768168558592,TheWilliamRamos,2390435473
