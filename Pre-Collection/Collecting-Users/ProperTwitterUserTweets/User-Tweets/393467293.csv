"I'm sitting here watching ""Amend"" on Netflix, which is hosted by Will Smith, and was wondering why he was trending on Twitter at the same time. It turns out, it was not related. Something about an awards show and a guy who played an important role in Beverly Hills Ninja.",1508294919064018945,Tater596,393467293
"It's a full week away from #DukevsUNC in the Final Four, and I already can't bear to watch.",1508266981656608772,Tater596,393467293
"Fitterer highlighted competition at QB, LT, and pass rushers as places they'd still be looking for in free agency. #Panthers",1507388765370830848,Tater596,393467293
"If Kyler Murray to the #Panthers is just a pipe dream, it's still the best dream I've had recently for this team. So let me have it on a Friday... because your next best option is to get your LT in the draft, and squat on next season.",1507383168579608605,Tater596,393467293
People really don't understand how deep in the bones this rivalry is in North Carolina. No Tarheel fan is rooting for coach K to get a Natty on his way out. It just isn't the way it is. You're asking a Michigan fan to root for Ohio State in the CFP here. It's just as deep. https://t.co/lRgL3KSut9,1507382333271429122,Tater596,393467293
"Follow the money? Maybe? I can tell you I'd be all in on THIS. Kyler Murray can win you a Super Bowl, and then you get to use your draft pick on best LT available. GIVE ME THIS OPTION. https://t.co/cSfRP6Dz7c",1507377358822645769,Tater596,393467293
My stance on guys like Jimmy G and Baker is super clear. There's no point in acquiring a guy for the #Panthers team that's good enough to win just enough to stick you with a mid round pick every year and nothing more. I'd rather roll the dice on unknowns than acquire mediocrity.,1507219521286942741,Tater596,393467293
"Surely, he wouldn't make a move until Training camp, but I'd much prefer to see Cam play next year behind a way better line than constant sad Darnold. https://t.co/IjIpMAPsMc",1506036739621720065,Tater596,393467293
Jameis Winston signing anywhere should not have affected this subject matter. https://t.co/U4K0ioWjY8,1505985978778980359,Tater596,393467293
"Truthfully, #Panthers fans can relate in serious ways. Hurts to watch a great QB walk away from an org that never QUITE did right by him. https://t.co/VUboKdhUH3",1505985194209202187,Tater596,393467293
