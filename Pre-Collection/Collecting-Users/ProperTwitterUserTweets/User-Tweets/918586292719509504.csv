Contract + trade comp being equal- who would you want most on the #Jets,1511339620147109899,Jets_Dan,918586292719509504
Chris Olave is my WR1 in the draft https://t.co/z5BfqvVvkp,1511076364924903428,Jets_Dan,918586292719509504
"Would you rather have Travon Walker @ #4 or Devonte Wyatt @ #10?

The #Jets need for a pass rush is huge, but imagine Wyatt and Quinnen unleashing each other.",1509694741696421890,Jets_Dan,918586292719509504
"If there’s a good TE like Ruckert or Ferguson available in round 4-5 the #Jets should still go for it. 

It’ll take 2-3 years for the guy to be ready to start anyway. Plus I bet Uzomah would be a good mentor. The guy just has to play ST",1509329553373736966,Jets_Dan,918586292719509504
"Let’s go! Todd was an underrated coach who just wasn’t the right type of guy at that time for the #Jets.

Absolutely deserves another shot, and happy to see him get it. https://t.co/YEaNAdxv04",1509327214902452225,Jets_Dan,918586292719509504
"The ‘22 CB draft class is really strong. I see 6+ week 1 starters.

Looks like the Jets have an intriguing kicker battle on their hands between Eddy Pineiro and Greg Zuerlein,1507731238169235456,Jets_Dan,918586292719509504

"I’d like to see the Jets bring in a decent bargain OT (this year’s Moses). Veteran 1-2 year deal.

It would provide security if Becton or Fant go down and allow the Jets to focus on Sauce/WR/Edge in the first round.",1507000278117240837,Jets_Dan,918586292719509504
Yes. They absolutely should. @nyjets https://t.co/NHKC7UAXaP,1506721298638151682,Jets_Dan,918586292719509504
