I would believe bridge has been replaced and no more construction on I75 before I would believe a word from the Castellini family.  Philâ€™s comments today lost the little bit of trust the fans had left for this front office. https://t.co/3EvMYUx3nL,1514079646240980998,imfiveonethree,23968025
Wow took a PR team 8 hours to release 3 sentences and this is the best they could come up with?  Phil you have already tarnish the Reds and embarrassed the city of Cincinnati. The fans have proved we will spend money on a winner look at UC and Bengals. Sell the team Bob! https://t.co/vOmtmLsQgB,1514057039961632772,imfiveonethree,23968025
100% correct Reds owners donâ€™t care about winning since they owned the team in 06 only 5 winning seasons so far.

"Threatens the fans relocating on our holiday Opening Day. Bob and Phil havenâ€™t built a winner in 15 years 0 playoffs wins, trades players for players that are injured. Past two years Mike Brown has spent 173 million more than the Reds which led to going to the SB. https://t.co/9NA8VNAhRn",1513998937702768646,imfiveonethree,23968025
