"The Laczynski move makes sense since the #Flyers are bound to get one of their missing forwards back. As for Sandstrom, the team doesn’t play again until Saturday so this doesn’t necessarily mean that Hart will be good to go. But something to keep an eye on. https://t.co/L6zptpaSuC",1514648192532504578,a_melendez10,40092508
"Honestly if there’s even a small chance Hart could be out for the last stretch, I say just shut him down and give Sandstrom the rest of the season. https://t.co/12BoUUd5ig",1514344196940959758,a_melendez10,40092508
"The Sandstrom and Laczynski recalls make sense based on Hart and Atkinson getting hurt. Guessing someone on defense must be hurt, but not sure why they wouldn’t just put Yandle in since they have an extra defenseman. https://t.co/OIN3jpct6Y",1514333993940004872,a_melendez10,40092508
Guess I have to continue watching the @Canucks because Pettersson always has multi-point games whenever I watch.,1514083957997985795,a_melendez10,40092508

Yeo mentioned yesterday that he might switch Tippett and Brink around for size/physicality reasons. Looks like he did indeed make that change. https://t.co/LMXTodrpPc,1513983613301370889,a_melendez10,40092508
"The Phillies have scored all five runs while I’ve been in the car, guess I can’t leave.",1513694039727652866,a_melendez10,40092508

"Among the changes Yeo could make, one is moving York to the second pairing with Risto. If that is the case, York would be ""happy to be home"" on the left side. Playing on the right was a learning experience for him, felt he did was good in some areas but bad in others.",1513561375498506245,a_melendez10,40092508
