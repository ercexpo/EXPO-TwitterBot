Have you played this game? You should because FFX is my all time favorite video game. FFX-2 is a cringefest abomination. https://t.co/OvQl9ajrgb,1514835000222367745,CincySeabee,257731799
"I just realized I got rid of my last very tattered Reds t-shirt, so tomorrow I will be a Bengals fan at a Reds game which is honestly much more in character for me anyway. Bengals jersey Reds cap. Kind of a standard outfit for me anyway.",1514834372695711744,CincySeabee,257731799
Bro. I have to go down to LAX to pick my family at midnight tomorrow. The Reds play the Dodgers at 7:10 pm and I'm off work. Ummmm yes.,1514828500963786754,CincySeabee,257731799

I can't wait for the 1st round pick that's a huge reach or surprise that pushes a player we all think is better down the board. There's always a few. Rashaad Penny. Alex Leatherwood. That could be the difference in getting the guy the Bengals want at 31.,1514745287444738052,CincySeabee,257731799
"My dream Bengals targets in each round:

31: Tyler Linderbaum/Kaiir Elam
63: Trey McBride/ Demarvin Leal
95: Zyon McCollum/ Cam Jurgens
136: Charlie Kolar/ Coby Bryant

I realize these may be too good to be true. That's why it says dream.",1514666143927050243,CincySeabee,257731799

I was in Navy bootcamp in January 2010 when the Bengals played the Jets in the playoffs. Obviously did not watch and never bothered to go back and watch. How bad was it?,1514389619344699392,CincySeabee,257731799
