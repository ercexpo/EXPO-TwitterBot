"Some of my concerns heading into tomorrow. 

The Pels have the 3rd best player on the floor no matter how you slice it. 

Keys for me 
1) PG needs to be the best player on the court 
2) Create and Knock down open 3s 
3) Limit Senior, need more Terance and Roco 
4) CROWDD https://t.co/UdI8fqZY7Z",1514692084841680924,DimeDropperPod,1271550504854646784

"One of my biggest issues the other night. Reggie and Paul took the same amount of shots in the 4th. 

Reggie: 1/6
Paul: 3/6

And mind you paul missed his first and then proceeded to go 3/5. Reggie made his first and bricked the rest.

"Clippers need to avoid stupid mistakes tomorrow. Lapses in concentration like letting the Wolves hit a buzzer beating 3 after a MADE FREE THROW is inexcusable. 

Momentum is everything. #ClipperNation
