"My goodness, Emmanuel Rodriguez has reached all five times tonight, collecting a pair of hits and three(!) more walks. https://t.co/lHo8xRRMe4",1514787807708913672,TFTwins,145326340
"Here's Louie Varland striking out a batter in under 30 seconds.

He works fast, throws a ton of strikes and will just bully hitters with his fastball when appropriate (like here, facing the No. 9 hitter). https://t.co/7jcuGUxD0L",1514784793392664576,TFTwins,145326340
Anthony Prato came into today hitting .429/.579/.643 (1.222 OPS) for Cedar Rapids. He picked up his fifth stolen base of the season in the first game of their doubleheader and now has his first homer of the year in Game 2. https://t.co/gRalHrJFur,1514776882935332864,TFTwins,145326340
"Emmanuel Rodriguez basically flip-flopping his K% and BB% from last year is the most eye-opening thing that's happened in the Twins system so far to me.
