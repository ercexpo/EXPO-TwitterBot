"Wouldnt blame him one bit. This is all on @JeanieBuss. You allow Linda and Kurt Rambis to shadow operate, this is what happen. They don't deserve Lebron. https://t.co/7KdFniWRxE",1514237172756398081,Nas1781,1091096568290250754

"Is this the kind of legacy you want to leave for yourself, @JeanieBuss? Dr. Buss wouldn't have waited this long to cut the cord on Vogel, Pelinka, and would never have listened to the Rambii. He was a progressive thinker. He hired the best basketball minds. U employ Melrose Place",1511698542993231880,Nas1781,1091096568290250754

Quin Snyder is the choice. And Troy Weaver should replace Pelinka. https://t.co/Voyf61DrRx",1511350926908534784,Nas1781,1091096568290250754
