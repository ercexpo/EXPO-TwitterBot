Like i said before. RT is usually a 2nd rounder. Don’t be surprised if that’s where we pick one.,1512538192666320897,NYGdailyFeed,246588499

If the Giants traded back and gain additional late round assets would you take a late round flier on LB Damone Clark who won’t be ready until 2023 season?,1511358071871787009,NYGdailyFeed,246588499
Not a good look for Kadarius Toney.. missed a ton of time last year and should have been the 1st one through the door this morning. Smh,1511141218419363847,NYGdailyFeed,246588499
Giants Restructuring the big 3 contracts would only handcuff the Giants thru 2023. 2024 they would be totally free of those big cap contracts. And we would still have roughly 75mil in cap space for 2023.,1510973303153905683,NYGdailyFeed,246588499
Going to have to restructure Kenny Golladay too. Watch. No choice,1510967854857920513,NYGdailyFeed,246588499
I told y’all one of those contracts would be restructured. Have no choice. Might have to do Leo too,1510966116679565312,NYGdailyFeed,246588499
