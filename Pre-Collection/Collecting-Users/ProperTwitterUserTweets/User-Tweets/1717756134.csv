"IT IS NO LONGER
this
heaviness
lowered at times together with you
into the hour. It is
another.

It is the wight building back the void
that would
accompany you.
Like you, it has no name. Perhaps
you two are one and the same. Perhaps
one day you also will call
me so.

"TO MY RIGHT - who? The deathwoman.
And you, to my left, you?

The traveling-sickles at the extra-
celestial place
mime themselves whitish-grey
into moon swallows, into star swifts,

I dip to that place
and pour an urnful
down you,
into you.
