"Mother,

Our first trip away from home starts tonight. We have travelled coast to coast &amp; are ready to take on the San Diego regiment. SSG Morton will be the sidearm leading the way. Consistency from our offensive units will prove vital. Will send updates soon!

"Mother,

After the offensive onslaught last eve, we were stifled by the gNats today. My sidearm served in an acceptable fashion, however I was hit with return fire that has me being evaluated in the infirmary. We head west tomorrow to take on the Fathers in Cali.

"Mother,

PVT Elder led well but the story of our victory tonight was the explosions our offensive units dropped on those pesky gNats. Almost everyone took part in the onslaught with SGT Albies leading the way. Back in action tomorrow as I lead our men back into battle!

"Mother,

Today we return to battle against those pesky gNats. Following last night’s battle PVT Davidson &amp; PVT Contreras were sent back to our training unit to make space for the man who will lead our soldiers to battle tonight, PVT Bryce Elder. We shall press on!

"Mother,

Outside of PVT Strider, our sidearms struggled again today. We shall not worry or put too much weight into these early battles. We know what our platoon is capable of after our early struggles last campaign. We must regroup and return to battle tomorrow!

"Mother,

Tonight PFC Ynoa leads us into battle against a very familiar foe. The Washington gNats are traveling south &amp; we are ready to battle! Our sidearms performance have been up and down thus far but I blame that on a short training program. Updates to come.

Love,

"Mother,

Our efforts today faltered &amp; we split our series of battles with the Cincinnati regiment. SPC Anderson was inaccurate and hit by return fire early. We received solid backup from sidearm relief &amp; we fought valiantly but for now it’s time to focus on the gNats.

"Mother,

Today we rise early to prepare for our final battle against the platoon from Cincinnati. SPC Anderson will lead our men into battle here in Atlanta. PFC Ozuna and SGT Albies led the way in an early offensive burst that we defended well. More updates to come!

"Mother,

We emerged tonight’s battle victorious! PVT Wright led extremely well while SPC Smith shut down the offensive units of the Cincinnati regiment as we finished out another victory today! We wrap up our series of battles with Cinci tomorrow! Updates to come!

I have enclosed this cool photo that was drawn by @CodyRogers10 that sums up all of the awards I have received from the last campaign. I hope this makes your heart as happy as it has made mine!
