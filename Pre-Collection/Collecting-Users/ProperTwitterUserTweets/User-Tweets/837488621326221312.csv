I glanced at this clip with no sound and legit thought the actor who played Frank from succession was in studio https://t.co/KnqUfnJXPN https://t.co/yZZKuKDhs9,1514592812968337409,_CLEology,837488621326221312
Boy idk if I‚Äôm rolling Naylor back in to race Rodon Friday. Lefty / lefty is tough and Rodon is damn good.,1514445926605148162,_CLEology,837488621326221312
That is not even close to the same thing. One is a playoff game. The other is not a playoff game. The Wolves hosted playoff game(s) as recent as ‚Äò17-‚Äò18. The #Browns have not hosted a playoff game since ‚Äò94. One #NFL playoff win = 4 #NBA playoff wins. So on and so forth. https://t.co/R0EHUjffJZ,1514429146679681028,_CLEology,837488621326221312

Did you say this before the season or just after we went 4-2 through 6 games and lead the league in scoring? https://t.co/3jrgZhxiS2,1514406838623776770,_CLEology,837488621326221312
"A Friday night home opener is cool AF. I know the play-in is going on across the walkway but man there is gonna be some kinda buzz in downtown Cleveland on Friday with the way the Guard has played and with the #Cavs shot at the playoffs, especially if JA is cleared. Can‚Äôt wait!",1514403389936971777,_CLEology,837488621326221312
"Something tells me Bradley and Chang may be in Columbus come May 2nd. 

I don‚Äôt see how either get any run once Naylor is back on Friday. That‚Äôs a good problem to have.

"I have tix to the home opener AND the play-in‚Ä¶but my mom is the biggest Tribe / Guard fan ever and the home opener tix were her Christmas present so I‚Äôm taking her to the home opener. Gave the play-in tix to my wife and her mom. 

Husband / Son of the year is a one man race üèÜ",1514359367973453825,_CLEology,837488621326221312
"Triston‚Äôs velocity was up 1.5 MPH on average today vs. last year. Was hitting 94-96 MPH regularly. If that holds, tossing in his deceptive delivery, he‚Äôs gonna be so tough to hit. #ForTheLand",1514355168040689676,_CLEology,837488621326221312
"The Guard has a run diff of +23 through 6 games (two road series). The next closest is NYM @ +15 and HOU @ +11

That seems good.
