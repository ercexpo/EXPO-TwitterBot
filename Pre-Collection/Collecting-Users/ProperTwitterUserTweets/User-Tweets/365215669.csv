Not sure I'd call losing Jesse Davis a subtraction. It's more addition by subtraction. But I'm guessing they didn't have room for a third column. #Dolphins https://t.co/vz422W2ZTa,1513908874620948482,PatrikNohe,365215669
Is there a better feeling in the world than getting that deep belly giggle from your toddler?,1513627173684404224,PatrikNohe,365215669
The fact Atlanta lost this dude for the season and THEN won it all anyway is still insane to me. Just getting him healthy is bigger than any free agent acquisition or trade the Braves could have made. https://t.co/fiZJzXisF7,1512564985859391499,PatrikNohe,365215669
"I shouldn't have to say this but don't take me at face on here. I'm just shit posting, if you held my feet to the fire I might sing a different tune. And none of it is hateful, except for the yokel stuff. Yall really shouldn't be allowed on the internet.",1512228436475011076,PatrikNohe,365215669
"I love how Twitter reminds me constantly how many people in this country are functionally retarded. This person probably shouldn't be allowed to vote, own a gun or reproduce. https://t.co/0lVUW5RHMV",1512222492726857731,PatrikNohe,365215669
"Also if you tried to hold me down and wipe the eye black off my face I would try to kick your ass. I might not succeed. But we would not be able to co-exist after that. What an arrogant, bullshit move.",1512219640608575491,PatrikNohe,365215669
"I love these inbred country born retards that are like, ""if you want to cheer MY braves..."" They're not your Braves. You don't play for them. Could never own them. You arent associated with them. They give no fucks about you. You slackjawed yokels are not the arbiters of fanhood.",1512219260281671686,PatrikNohe,365215669
"I'm already sick of the Freeman talk. If he wanted to be a Brave, he could have been. He didn't. So thanks, and now fuck off. I'll cheer you again when you retire. Until then you're dead to me and I'll boo you like I did Glavine.",1512217764592865283,PatrikNohe,365215669
"Love that Atlanta let Chipper throw out the first pitch. I'll always love Freddie, but you never deserved to carry Chipper's jockstrap. You'll always be a second tier Brave to me. Next to the traitor Tom Glavine.",1512216256673460233,PatrikNohe,365215669
I have three Freddie Freeman jerseys hanging in my closet that I know objectively I will never wear again lol. Going to need to find a new one this season.,1512195960843157511,PatrikNohe,365215669
