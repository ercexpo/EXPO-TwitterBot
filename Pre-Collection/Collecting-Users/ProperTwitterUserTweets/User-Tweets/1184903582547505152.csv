"Not smart by him. The Marlins are facing a lefty and he hit .237 with a .282 OBP vs lefties last year. Not to mention, he's a .241 career hitter, he doesn't have the room to complain especially considering you don't see anyone else publicly complaining about sitting. https://t.co/9K0xbu4aQe",1512894775879475201,strictlysportsp,1184903582547505152
"That hit on Tyler Motte, and the many others that have been laid upon Rangers players tonight is why they have to play Ryan Reaves. I can't remember a game this year where this many Rangers have been hit hard. #NYR",1512239288792100927,strictlysportsp,1184903582547505152
"The baseball gods are in action. Defending #Brewers NL CY Young Corbin Burnes struck out 58 hitters before issuing a walk in 2021, an MLB record. Today he walked the leadoff hitter, Rafael Ortega, for the #Cubs.",1512136439185788933,strictlysportsp,1184903582547505152

"I'm all for players staying with a team. I think it's particularly endearing after seeing Freeman leave ATL. However, Ramirez is taking a pay cut. MLBN has Ramirez ranked as the #1 3B and he'll be making 24.8 a year.
