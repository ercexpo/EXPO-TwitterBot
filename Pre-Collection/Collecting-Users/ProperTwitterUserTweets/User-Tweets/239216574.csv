Lot of talk of Jets coaching him at Senior Bowl so they would like himâ€¦. Can tell you from being there that Robert Saleh tore Trevor Penning a new one for this play. Itâ€™s a lowlight not a highlight. https://t.co/BEFAmZTN4M,1514966230603550727,Willpa11,239216574
"This edge class is deep as hell though man, probably too low on GK and to high on Maye but there is like 14 guys who could make an argument they belong on here as 1st and 2nd round guys. If you need an Edge itâ€™s a good year to grab one! https://t.co/svz7kojqz2",1514948075823013888,Willpa11,239216574
Pretty decent bull rush from Sheldon Rankinsâ€¦. Definition of walking the guard into the QBs lap ðŸš€ https://t.co/X6WIXYpekl,1514945581612994567,Willpa11,239216574
"Final positional top 7 rankings each day, next up Edge:

#1 Kayvon Thibodeaux 
#2 Aidan Hutchinson 
#3 Jermaine Johnson II
#4 Travon Walker
#5 Boye Maye 
#6 Arnold Ebiketie
#7 George Karlaftis 

Probably the group Iâ€™m gonna get the most pushback on is Edge and OT butðŸ¤·",1514935673589010435,Willpa11,239216574
