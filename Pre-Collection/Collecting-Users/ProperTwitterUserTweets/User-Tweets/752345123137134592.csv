Absolutely but People conflate drug jail street hiphop as being better because it resonates more with them and nothing infuriates more than that NOTHING..I ask myself did y’all niggas like 80s and early 90s hiphop if street hood rap mean the world to you https://t.co/mlze0bX9ks,1514954610225602567,Watson3172,752345123137134592
Hiphop is subjective. What’s not subjective is the ability to rap. Example Phoaroh Monch is a better rapper than Jim Jones but Jim Jones may personally mean more to you….Black Thought is a better rapper than 50 but 50 may personally mean more to you..get it see the point?,1514951111777660928,Watson3172,752345123137134592
