"Play The Kids isnâ€™t just a Thibs thing. It is a thibs thing, but itâ€™s not a unique to Thibs thing. https://t.co/bAGa3Dlx5T",1514787809021681672,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
"Pretty fascinating.

And elite reaction from the boys ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/qDrO9Fggiy",1514786651297370123,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
Tanking needs to end. Itâ€™s the worst thing in sports. Thereâ€™s no good justification for it. I despise it.,1514699993524932612,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
"Incredible.

Also, Haired Thibs spotted. https://t.co/Ytsj0QQ2WX https://t.co/f7nmVGAXeC",1514693534414262284,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
"These crowds in Minnesota and New Orleans have been spectacular. 

Just give fans stakes and meaningful, competitive, hard-fought basketball games. 

Donâ€™t need to be contenders to peak interest! That concept is so massively overstated.",1514452153427021830,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
CJ been searching for a backcourt mate like Jose Alvarado his whole career.,1514433905813860352,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
"CJ is such a wild talent. One of the quickest transfers from dribble to shot in the world.

Lots of downplaying of how good this dude is when he was traded.",1514432885486411782,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
"These teams are so apparently average and itâ€™s wild to see them play in an atmosphere with stakes like this. The energy doesnâ€™t match the product lol. 

Long live the play-in.",1514421587403026432,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
"Really enjoyed Wolves inverted horns set where D-Lo is the one catching elbow extended (usually spot for the big) and making decisions out of that with clever off-ball movement. 2 examples:

1/2) Looks like McDaniels is going to set a fade screen for Bev, but slips it beautifully https://t.co/Ja99AsE9NV",1514274303658893312,BenRitholtzNBA,68732111
"For those that mightâ€™ve missed this, JJ is SO good at this, Dâ€™Antoni is an awesome and open guest, and some really interesting NYK tidbits on:

- Linsanity
- MSG (he loves it)
- Steph (we coulda had him ðŸ˜”)
- Interesting words about COTY and firingsâ€¦
