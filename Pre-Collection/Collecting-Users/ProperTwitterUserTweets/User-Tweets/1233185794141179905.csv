"The landscape of the NFL is changing. And, while, defense is probably still the key to winning in this league, playmakers on offense, (specifically pash catches), outside of the QB position, has become a value part of winning…",1514711511155019782,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
"There’s people arguing Shanahan’s scheme made Deebo Samuel, yet 90% of the D Lineman who has been coached by Kris K produced at decently high level. Why aren’t there any arguments claiming the coach &amp; scheme of our D Line made Bosa?",1514708446515539979,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
"Kenny Golladay is a contested catch specialist. DK, is more of a bigger Tyreek Hill type of player, imo, who has the speed to run past players consistently. Kenny &amp; DK are a tad bit different, &amp; if I had to choose one I’ll say Pickens is more of a Golladay type player… https://t.co/GzBlvSbljO",1514541408572657664,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
I went to school &amp; played one year with BJ Byrd at Morehead State (2020-2021). That man’s a BALLER! He’s an electrifying playmaker! A threat to score whenever he touches the ball. Has return skills also. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s on someone’s NFL roster come next season… https://t.co/hKOEKz5EQN,1514338988747804675,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
"Imo, the only way the 49ers trade Deebo Samuel (They’re blown away) is if they get, somewhat, QB-like compensation for him. A team would have to offer, MINIMUM, two 1st rounders, a 2nd, a few late picks, &amp; give Deebo a new contract, probably just south of $30m per year… https://t.co/L7vhHj5cun",1514022529375088653,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
"I hate the, “Deebo only had 1 year of elite productivity” argument as a reason for not paying Deebo. Armstead had 9 sacks in 4 years while consistently being injured, played well his contract year, &amp; got paid…Jimmie Ward put together one healthy season in 2019, &amp; got paid…",1513604891046031371,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
"Deebo’s had injury issues. But, when he’s been on the field, he’s consistently been the most productive 49er since 2019. It’s not often where a WR is, not only the core piece of an offense, but, is legitimately more important than the QB…That’s been Deebo, the last 2/3 seasons…",1513602225989468163,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
It’s easy to feel like we’re entitled or guaranteed to live a long life. No one wakes up in the morning believing it’ll be their last day alive. Days like today exemplifies how short life is &amp; how fast it could be gone…,1512874217716465670,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
"Deebo Samuel leaving, imo, would look terrible for John Lynch. Reason being… it’ll basically show that he’s been lying this entire time, stating numerous times that Deebo will be a 9er for a long time…",1512003869064282112,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
"This entire post is mook. Deshaun Watson, the last time we’ve seen him, was a top 2 QB in the NFL. I wouldn’t place too much emphasis on his win/loss record at all, because he played on a terrible team, paired with a terrible FO… https://t.co/k3pIP4q7sN",1510936471561289730,DavidSportTalk2,1233185794141179905
