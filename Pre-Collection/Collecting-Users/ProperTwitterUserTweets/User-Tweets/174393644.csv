12 years ago today I witnessed Aroldis Chapmanâ€™s Minor League debut for the @LouisvilleBats in Toledo. Dude hit 104 multiple times that day as a starting pitcher. Even the Mudhens fans were going nuts every time the scoreboard would update his MPH. https://t.co/fVdHflVJur,1513564867705417732,nickseuberling,174393644
