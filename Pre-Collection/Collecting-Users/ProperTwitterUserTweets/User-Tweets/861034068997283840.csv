Why buy Twitter for 43B because along with Neuralink Not Metaverse ‘Could Put Man Fully Into Virtual Reality’ https://t.co/z7xt7rNYha,1514653104137986050,Cesarspr,861034068997283840
Elon Musk buying Twitter for 43B. His plan is more than just the “restoring the 2nd amendment.” That’s just silly guys lol My guess is competing with the Metaverse. Create an alternate reality where real life and social media life clash along with Neuralink a company he owns.,1514651182706343943,Cesarspr,861034068997283840
Lol my dude Elon Musk has stupid money. My goodness! https://t.co/xaVvib9FAW,1514647943986491401,Cesarspr,861034068997283840
Anything Elon Musk buys turns into profit. What does he have planned for Twitter? It’s hardly about the 2nd amendment and bringing certain people back (that doesn’t make money) I’m interested to know what he envisions Twitter becoming?,1514645882599362566,Cesarspr,861034068997283840
