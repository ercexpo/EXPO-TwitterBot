Offensive minded draft. Picked up a lot of extra draft capital in 2023 too. #Texans https://t.co/53od6QUJ98,1509511655775944705,TexansSavant,1048219309179379712
Early morning mock… I’d love this draft. Picked up an extra first and third next year in the first trade. https://t.co/loEIeXTAYN,1508755037207605249,TexansSavant,1048219309179379712
"I wonder why Terrell Edmunds is still out there in free agency?

He’s been consistent all four years and last year he started all 17 games and put up these numbers:

2 INT, 6 PD, 1.0 sack, 89 tackles, 8 TFL

He held opposing QBs to a 63.9 QB rating when he was targeted.",1508582877960847360,TexansSavant,1048219309179379712
Thoughts? Also picked up two future second round picks in those deals. https://t.co/8nzB4rI1H4,1507460320373227528,TexansSavant,1048219309179379712
