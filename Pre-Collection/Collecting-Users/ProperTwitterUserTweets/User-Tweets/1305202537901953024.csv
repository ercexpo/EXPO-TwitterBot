He's by far ones of my favorite fighters. The I Kill You i kill everybody is what he says at interviews. Never wanted to make it seem like I was saying something like that to him #UFC273 2 of 2,1513322065788497920,VZKFPanda,1305202537901953024
To whoever reported my tweet yesterday. I understand where you're coming from with just what I said. However if you know the fighter i tagged you clearly understand that 1 I wasn't threatening the fighter i was simply quoting him. So I never wished @KChimaev any harm. 1 of 2,1513321772849926145,VZKFPanda,1305202537901953024
