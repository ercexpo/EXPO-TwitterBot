".@Crunchyroll is there a reason Birdie Wing is premiering at 8:00 PM instead of 8:00 AM?
I was willing to ignore it when it happened last week since the acquisition was just announced, but it premiered at the exact same time this week.
Now I want to know what the error is. https://t.co/EAHKKuVV9Y",1514251309313974273,0215MADman,2346198798
