This is what happens when the Phillies hit on the first pitch. Bryce Harper why would you swing at the absolute first pitch. #phillies67,1514787908552577027,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
What a grab by Bryce Harper! #phillies67 https://t.co/NfSR6aEK11,1514785204778401793,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
My goodness that slider was a beauty to watch. Hand beat out Cooper in a battle at the plate. #phillies67 https://t.co/MsrcXkGirV,1514778907060301828,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
I got scared that JT Realmuto hit that inside high pitch but his speed made him safe at first base. #phillies67,1514759666726846468,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
Do you think Philadelphia will struggle against the Miami Marlins tonight? #phillies67 https://t.co/9DVIpkAW1E,1514697742240690182,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
Is Bobby Brink taking a shot at his line mates? #flyers68 https://t.co/yKrXevEbnn,1514066381742002181,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
"The Phillies lost this game simply because this lineup is not in sync at the moment. Philadelphia has to train their minds not to swing at sliders, changeups, and other pitches not to swing at outside pitches most of the time. It affected them a win tonight. #phillies67 https://t.co/arIKxmJJ36",1514063784872222725,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
I guess the city of Philadelphia forgave Alec Bohm for those 3 errors yesterday. They were cheering him on last inning. #phillies67 https://t.co/YV4yVb8abl,1514056231043969032,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
JT Realmuto! Wow! What an arm! #phillies67 https://t.co/8oXsgVAZHH,1514053490233982981,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
Lol I donâ€™t care if Stott made a mistake here. #phillies67 https://t.co/x8K7VGlgUq,1514051034653638659,ChatSnake,1353838763017981954
