The way Jimmy and Kevin spoke about Baker makes it clear to me he‚Äôs played his last snap with the Browns - this idea floating around that he‚Äôd start while Watson is suspended flies against everything the team has done (Brissett) and said,1508644355761848321,BrownsAnalysis6,1305763174373785600
No hesitation - @tonygrossi - he has me blocked but Tony Grossi would get slapped all over Cleveland if this were real https://t.co/0qGHzq5LDa,1508537640626233347,BrownsAnalysis6,1305763174373785600

"could be the smartest move this team has ever made OR the dumbest move this team ever made. All depends on Watson‚Äôs character and willingness to be a solid person and player. 

Anyone who thinks they know what will happen when a player is guaranteed 230 mil - is lying https://t.co/fV1VkvpF4j",1506322015896018953,BrownsAnalysis6,1305763174373785600
