Rodgers will need a lot of help with Adams departing. This is a small step forward https://t.co/GSOBPDAkPe,1514687951376166923,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
What a bad take by @ColinCowherd on @TheHerd on @ClaytonKersh22 possible perfect game. Perfect games are historic and are rare. Maybe a no-hitter you can pull him but not in a perfect game,1514668344787492867,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
You should've kept going. Perfect games are so rare and are near impossible in today's game. Sad! https://t.co/mqojiTyn4D,1514360120506998785,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
Crazy how much things change so quickly. Hoping we can see more of this sooner rather than later https://t.co/yIAaBO1jCT,1514355188739543045,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
"That’s 100 percent false. T-Wolves would still have won, Warriors are better as well as the Suns, Nuggets, Grizzlies, Mavs, maybe even the Jazz https://t.co/OKIxmSPn7Q",1514099417632100356,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
Anthony Edwards and D’Angelo Russell stepped up big for the @Timberwolves with Towns struggling and in foul trouble. I like the T-wolves chances against the @memgrizz,1514098541202968577,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
Here’s the first Angel moment of the season and it’s hilarious. Curious if he got to speak into the mic tonight assuming he’s the crew chief on this crew https://t.co/DLcBD4QVGf,1513730556843868165,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
Nice work tonight by the boys!! Missed being out there tonight but it's a start in the right direction against what I would say is another top 5 team in the state. Now time to hope the winter storm stays away so the baseball season has minimal delay https://t.co/GbCSEJ3fNf,1513703940298358785,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
Not his fault the @Lakers had a failing year. Who’s going to be a better coach to turn the Lakers around? Roster needs to be retooled first https://t.co/o250Xc3M5h,1513387694390452230,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
I’m going with @KevinHarvick this evening from @MartinsvilleSwy https://t.co/RmvuOGOHiO,1512953456457396225,KarterKudrna33,1177035685389373442
