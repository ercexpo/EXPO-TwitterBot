Today is my brother's birthday &amp; the first without him. Spend the time you can &amp; tell those important you love them...because time is always too short &amp; there are no second chances. Happy birthday little brother...&amp; I miss you Ian. #fuckcancer https://t.co/shKZ5Hpmd7,1513933852728823813,zenspath,15443866
I'd like to go on record to state that while I said in a previous podcast that the Neo Geo Pocket Selection Vol 1 was an awesome idea...they should have enabled some sort of emulation for link cables...&amp; was told it was not possible. THAT SHIT IS IN THE GAME!!!!! #vindication,1513758440321126400,zenspath,15443866
Hey @LimitedRunGames...was the Neo Geo Pocket Selection Vol. 1 supposed to come with a card? Got mine in &amp; never found one in the packaging. :( https://t.co/9HdUOXF2wB,1513503619999580174,zenspath,15443866
