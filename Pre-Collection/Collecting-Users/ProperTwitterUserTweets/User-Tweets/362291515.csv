"Waiting on the 2022 NFL Schedule; and as a #Panthers fan, Matt Rhule is going to need help.

I'm not just any fan. I think I bring the magic. This happened attending my first ever away game.

"#mrpovON my former @hornets: Not to be negative, but it's no surprise that the Hornets lost. This team has been scared to win for years!

In many ways, it is not the players' fault. And I feel bad for the fans. There is one consensus: A weak ownership; and, it's sad to watch. https://t.co/cZvlUIJX1A",1514569946927226886,mrpovNA,362291515
"#mrpovON my former @hornets: My team since day 1. Good times in the 90s!

After their move to New Orleans, I backed the Bobcats since day 1.

In 2017, I finally saw the Hornets in Boston; where they were contenders. Instead, I saw why they are THE WORST NBA TEAM IN HISTORY. https://t.co/USvSfq2m4B",1514566333366620164,mrpovNA,362291515
"If @jrpsaki suggests Greg Abbott get rid of border checks on the Texas border, then...

...get rid of security gates at all sports venues because fans are missing the game. (same for concerts)
...get rid of security at govt buildings. It would reduce missing court times or appts.",1514276587025231873,mrpovNA,362291515
"Wait a minute!

I don't know about everyone, but for those who just want to get on the plane...

Person: ""You got to go through TSA!""
Me: But I'm missing my flight!

@jrpsaki, if you criticize @GregAbbott_TX, then you need to get rid of TSA https://t.co/BcmO0AWQJb",1514271670302695425,mrpovNA,362291515

"#mrpovON @CharlotteFC: I watched The @Panthers take YEARS for fans to get as amped for games. Sadly, it'll take years for #Charlotte area soccer fans to be as pumped as over half of the MLS teams.

Want to prove me wrong? Bring in better a better PR/marketing team. Good luck! https://t.co/WR4bG74dsC",1513412357535326209,mrpovNA,362291515
"Where is The @nytimes on Joe #Biden, #HunterBiden, #Russia, #Ukraine and #CHINA?

CHINA killed millions worldwide. Families are hurting and grieving because of China, Joe Biden and other's greed, but The NY Times think Middle East peacemaker Jared Kushner is a bigger priority? ðŸ™„ https://t.co/3DaMkuvQKN",1513366787127078919,mrpovNA,362291515
"#90DayFianceTellAll: Watching The #90DayFiance #BeforeThe90Days season, I'll say (and this was my most interesting observation all season), Mahogany was the only non-American that didn't have much subtitles.

It is very clear that even show also thought Mahogany had good English.",1513323577428230156,mrpovNA,362291515
"#mrpovON @BigBrotherCA: Watching Marty's HOH week on catchup.

I want #BBCAN's home version of Red Light, Green Light!

Gino had a ""techtronics"" moment in the veto. ""No-men-ies""ðŸ˜‚

Who had the worst HOH - Marty's 2nd or Kyle? OMG!

The ghost of Jess is alive! Bwahaha!
