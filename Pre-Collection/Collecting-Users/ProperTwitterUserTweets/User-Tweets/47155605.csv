"It would be weird if they started doing online prices for the United States based on the monetary value per state.

However it would actually show certain people that it's not as good as they think it is for to have a lower monetary value.",1514791988599566336,R_L_A_G,47155605

"I just realized, banning people from social media is actually not entirely a bad thing because it's the biggest pwn people can take to the platforms because they realize how things are so much better without it. Basically like telling that toxic ex you're better off without them",1514776755344592900,R_L_A_G,47155605
"Worst stereotype of people who oppose #Gamergate:
Male feminist that might have skeletons in their closet and a history of mistreating women and children.
Chronically stalks people after they block them, sometimes using groups of people.
Sexist men that think lowly of women.",1514765075478851604,R_L_A_G,47155605
"The insertion of the worst ""feminist"" is the most pointless insert ever... Did they insert it in just annoy people? #TIGERandBUNNY2",1514761084439248906,R_L_A_G,47155605
"People they say they got PTSD from gamergate, if they seriously have ptsd.... It wasn't from #gamergate, you shouldn't be trivializing a condition that people who have suffered trauma in some form have.

I came to terms with having it as a teenager and realizing it's not gone. https://t.co/hHOezTz4Ij",1514739840872497155,R_L_A_G,47155605
"This college professor doesn't really understand the social aspects of anything. It's not strange to see all the black people hanging out with the other black people, and the people who could speak a second language with people that can speak the languages. It's not segregation. https://t.co/C1gxztEhK6",1514723291151413261,R_L_A_G,47155605
Honestly I don't think anybody is really sucking up to him but more like having some amount of expectation of change that is coming. Honestly I think it's best there is change. Twitter needs a reasonable intuitive system and a better report system. https://t.co/Kg6m7WD6CF,1514705941396131845,R_L_A_G,47155605
"I'm really uncomfortable with the thought right now that y'all been seeing today it's just my childhood PTSD manifesting itself in a different way. I don't suffer flashbacks anymore but this bullshit does happen.

Sometimes I could stop myself if I just remember to look.",1514699238214619137,R_L_A_G,47155605
Sorry about mistaking your satire for the real thing but you are just way too close to the real thing well actually most of the people that seem to have control at Twitter since like 2014. https://t.co/yYHLBqB1cR,1514697063115673602,R_L_A_G,47155605
