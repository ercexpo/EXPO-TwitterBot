"RIP Tim, absolutely devastating 💔 when I was in high school I randomly added him on FB, bcuz I was a huge annoying DGD fan. he added me and one day I posted a link to Seven Years bySaosin and he liked it. Such a small thing but I’ve always remembered that for some reason. RIP ❤️ https://t.co/ykajsRcKtk",1514706922565476354,dramaclubjulian,1070759136713957376
