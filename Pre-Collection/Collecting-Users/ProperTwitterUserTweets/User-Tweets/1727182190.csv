"Lots of fun on our trip to HCCC today. Thank you @WHSMolina for helping organize. The students learned how to break down and bread a chicken, watched the preparation and sampled a delicious sauce, toured the entire building, and were treated to an amazing lunch! #wearebarrons https://t.co/Gbo542lhov",1511841475105107969,WHSVersuk,1727182190
