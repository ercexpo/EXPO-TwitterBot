Maâ€™am it was disrespectful of your son to keep impregnating her &amp; not committing. Sad this young man and his mother are talking like this. You should be grateful that @OWNTV is paying for this because he obviously couldnâ€™t. @OWNKeepItReal #marrymenow,1512971156768370691,nerdacitypod1,1970180846
Thank goodness he said yes. What would this young woman have done. Itâ€™s been 7 years. She shouldnâ€™t have to wait any longer. Smh. This poor young lady and those babies. #MarryMeNow,1512970011907866624,nerdacitypod1,1970180846
Really cringe. Melquinâ€™s mom is acting like itâ€™s all about her. Maâ€™am your son has three kids with this young woman. Itâ€™s been 7 years. How much longer should this woman wait to be committed to? Smh @OWNKeepItReal @rebeccalynnpope #MarryMeNow,1512968715570139143,nerdacitypod1,1970180846
