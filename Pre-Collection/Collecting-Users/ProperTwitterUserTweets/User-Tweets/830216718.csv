"Cole Ragans final line - 3.1 IP 3 H 0 R 1 BB 7 K. FB 93-95, unexplosive but located well along all four edges. 80-83 CH command was spotty but plus deception/velo gap/movement kept it effective. SL/CB mostly ineffective, soft. 13 swinging strikes by my count - 7 FB, 6 CH.",1513284965978492933,OGSchill,830216718
