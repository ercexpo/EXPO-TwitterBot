"Going back to the dogs in MLB.  Im 8-16 in baseball this year (impressive, I know) and 4 of those wins were plus money bets.  Its time to get back to whats been working.  If Im gonna be below 50% it might as well be on plus money bets https://t.co/BXvwnbsyJf",1514650868808929284,DMoney2171,929136967
Finally a positive day in MLB.  Only 2-1 but hell I will take it.  A solid day thanks to multiple hockey totals but gotta get my MLB game going.  Lets go!! https://t.co/dMDWft4t9X,1514579142821527552,DMoney2171,929136967
0-1 yesterday as my totals bet misses (shocker).  Early stuff with the Astros getting bet later https://t.co/AHNxnyBUBm,1514314884166660103,DMoney2171,929136967
"Only early game so why not...this is pretty much a ""rich hill sucks and the sox are supposed to have a good offense"" play. https://t.co/K2SJ7LeWzs",1513926216818073601,DMoney2171,929136967
Lol 0 for 5.  MIL cant score on the Os...NYM blow a 4 run lead in the 8th...illegal slide kills a rally...TB starter gets hurt in the 1st and his replacement should be stocking shelves somewhere...back at it today! https://t.co/7YKYV9aDOr,1513834456066498562,DMoney2171,929136967

An awful 0-4 MLB day for me as the 4 teams I bet on combined for 8 runs and included a blown save.  Lets try and bounce back with these 5 plays! https://t.co/KRK5Et63YS,1513164345055883268,DMoney2171,929136967
Had a nice afternoon with the wife and came home to a nice 0-3 MLB day.  Went back to whats been going well (NHL totals) and threw on one last MLB bet for today...best of luck! https://t.co/skKqbwrgqB,1512957705228591108,DMoney2171,929136967
