"Canes would be the runaway presidents trophy winner if they could beat real shitty teams, but they can’t, which I can never understand. They are the NHL’s version of the Steelers. Play to the level of their competition.",1514782983433056268,McElCaney,4094645183
"As I’ve said previously, the kid Kochetkov will be the backup by mid year next year",1514776845169819650,McElCaney,4094645183
Rough go for Teravainen. He looks like Martinook with the puck out there. Sporadic and wild as hell.,1514775933323931655,McElCaney,4094645183
"Rise, rinse, repeat https://t.co/9fG0XV7DiR",1514765692330860546,McElCaney,4094645183
Decline these power plays @Canes,1514748262053556227,McElCaney,4094645183
That was one of the worst power plays I’ve ever seen. Brutal. Sucked all the life out of the building.,1514747880942223362,McElCaney,4094645183
"Canes dominating early with no goals on the board, you say? We all know how this ends. Detroit will pot the first goal of the game.",1514745068493717511,McElCaney,4094645183
"This just seems like a nice way of saying “you ain’t cutting it kid”, especially considering Ryan Reaves and Dryden Hunt are in the same lineup. Maybe the kid just needs to munch on some press box popcorn and see a game from up high. https://t.co/GA0FzxEcow",1514376254107131905,McElCaney,4094645183
That third period was the best period the canes played all year. There is no close 2nd.,1514054571089350662,McElCaney,4094645183
I will say this for like the 1000th time. The third pair needs a puck mover like Bear. The 3rd pair gets hemmed in a lot because no one can move the puck between Cole and Smith.,1514037887490269194,McElCaney,4094645183
