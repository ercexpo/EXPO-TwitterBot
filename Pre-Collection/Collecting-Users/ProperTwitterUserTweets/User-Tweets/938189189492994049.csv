Quarterbacks can have a pretty nice feast by buying what’s on sale as well. Here’s a rookie doing the veteran thing and letting the defensive scheme work for him. Graciously accept what they’re offering you for free. https://t.co/xIODR0Nsyx,1514424194360033290,TheHonestNFL,938189189492994049
"Just made it through each of Trevor Lawrence’s snaps from week 18 against Indy, and his chart looks clean. Made the simple plays almost every chance he had, which is what the great QBs consistently do. The RB/TE/Slot efficiency will only pick up with Doug’s system. And then this. https://t.co/QA7KT0yegH",1514407624736915460,TheHonestNFL,938189189492994049
"It’s heartwarming to know that humans from so many different backgrounds —offense, defense, special teams, player eval, critical analysis, the written word— can come together for a common purpose and achieve something that will last in posterity. 2 Invert sucks ass. https://t.co/sbEl2ocWZT",1514381357841014788,TheHonestNFL,938189189492994049

I’ll go out on a limb and wager that Kyzir White will be a substantial upgrade at WLB alongside Edwards. Probably shouldn’t run any spot-drop/vision zones often (at all) in the NFL either. Cover 2 against tight formations is rough…kind of looks like Qrtrs with no M/M principles. https://t.co/tAdQ5p5Rj1,1514295088574349312,TheHonestNFL,938189189492994049
Derek Carr is a great dude and an under-appreciated QB who will now be handsomely compensated. Good for him. Love when great people get paid.,1514258983640514562,TheHonestNFL,938189189492994049

"This is a big boy throw. Have to hit the Flag route to the boundary void in a way that it allows the receiver to see it in and keep the feet in. This is a step late, but not nearly late enough to harm the execution. Should be mid-flight by the time the receiver turns his head. https://t.co/YOVGckCxnA",1514233778050322435,TheHonestNFL,938189189492994049
Mirrored Seam-Curls with the boundary side bender for post-open coverage. Every NFL QB needs to be able to execute this. https://t.co/YXrIG0Da6L,1514231607351291906,TheHonestNFL,938189189492994049
"Good pre-snap read to gauge the coverage contours, CB technique/alignment/leverage on the Blaze Out which is run perfectly by Smith. What a stud route runner. https://t.co/cYJ036jbVn",1514223957540589570,TheHonestNFL,938189189492994049
