Jose Trevino is an awesome pickup. for the #Yankees. Insane defensive catcher and has had some great at bats so far. #RepBx,1514792256154202112,Gmen_Navy_,1332523752551288833

I really can‚Äôt stand Yankee fans. They seriously don‚Äôt know how to give credit to the other player. 99 inside and Vlad still hit it. What else do you want Cole to do? Give me a break,1514397954177749002,Gmen_Navy_,1332523752551288833
Hurts to say but the Blue Jays own the Yankees until I am proven otherwise.,1513878928049508362,Gmen_Navy_,1332523752551288833
I‚Äôve been on the Clarke Schmidt train for a long time. Glad he‚Äôs pitching well. Keep it up Clarke. #RepBX #MLB,1513323204412067848,Gmen_Navy_,1332523752551288833

I expect the Yankees final offer to be 250M. If Judge doesn‚Äôt sign then I really don‚Äôt know what else they could‚Äôve done. They know losing Aaron Judge would be horrible. Really weird feeling.,1512433959984058369,Gmen_Navy_,1332523752551288833
