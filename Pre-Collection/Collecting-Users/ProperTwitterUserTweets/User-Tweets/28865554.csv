Bryson stott had had a great spring. When he gets sent down (and he will) don’t get pissed off. Just remember that the Phillies are going to need 15-16 pitchers and can roster all of them in April. They have 18 still on the 40 man including conrood and brogdon.,1509722904451244035,joecatz,28865554
So there’s a very real possibility with expanded 28 man rosters in April and 40 man crunch that the smart move is to keep stott at AAA until 4/1.,1509184771129331723,joecatz,28865554
"I think a ton of this roster stuff comes down to who benefits more from every day reps at AA/AAA and who benefits more from an hour in the cage with Kevin Long every day in April. For me, that’s absolutely Bohm and Stott both breaking camp and working to get them both ABs",1508843249313718289,joecatz,28865554
This opens up Stotts 40 man spot too.,1508842431617372173,joecatz,28865554
Man. Kind of makes you wonder if the org believes Kevin Long pulled some voodoo magic with Moniak…,1508838629468254212,joecatz,28865554
Shameless #ottoneu plug. Listen to me rant about cooper Hummel and Suzuki! https://t.co/SKjJAL4EWj,1508533687079604234,joecatz,28865554
"If you’re looking at advanced defensive metrics, castellanos sucks in LF. More likely he plays RF to spell Harper when Harper DHs.",1505630186053775361,joecatz,28865554
So Soler signs the same kind of deal as Correa. 3/36 with opt outs after this year and next so assuming a couple million on the opt out it’s likely a 1 year 15mm deal.,1505329237636616198,joecatz,28865554
I’m not kidding On Hamels. Sign the guy to a heavy incentive deal. Put him on the 60 day Il immediately. Let him try and rehab himself and pitch his last MLB inning where he should this season.,1505223381293142021,joecatz,28865554
You know who the Phillies should really sign on a one year deal right now? 38 year old Cole Hamels.,1505222438619168770,joecatz,28865554
