"I love love that Barry Jenkins, one of our best filmmakers, loved ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"". It's unique, bold, sometimes outre, and filled with a big-hearted love for movies that it deserves huge audience numbers! https://t.co/olcEriDArw",1513700220613259266,FrancisSadac,17515151
"Can't wait to see what would be this year's Cannes to Oscar breakout like ""Drive My Car"" was last year. The Kore-eda, Park, and Ostlund films sound promising. And what about that ""mystery"" David Lynch movie! https://t.co/YtjB5jbnWf",1513579696134393857,FrancisSadac,17515151

"Thank you @thenordicmuseum and @seattlerep for a thrilling afternoon with The National Theater of Norway's resident playwright Camara Lundestad Joof. It was great to see a staged reading of her acclaimed play ""They must birth us or f@ck us to love us"" and hear her speak after.",1513319727799578625,FrancisSadac,17515151
"""Tokyo Vice"", like ""West Side Story"", is another example of POC actors doing twice the work to minimize the harm Ansel Elgort's presence wreaks on the film. Why does Hollywood keep casting this accused abuser?",1513191355085860869,FrancisSadac,17515151
"What's the point in casting Ansel Elgort in ""Tokyo Vice""? His line readings are wooden, he has one expression (cocky) and he doesn't look anything like Jake Adelstein. Thank goodness for Ken Watanabe and Rinko Kikuchi, otherwise that pilot episode would have sunk into oblivion",1513190621460135939,FrancisSadac,17515151
