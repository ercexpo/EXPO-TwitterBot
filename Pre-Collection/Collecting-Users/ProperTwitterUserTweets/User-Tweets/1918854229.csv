"üèÄLuka Doncic Injury ""Update""

@ShamsCharania says Luka is expected to miss Game 1, but he didn't provide any new information on @Stadium. I think he'll likely miss Game 1 based on the typical injury recovery.

"No where in this clip did Shams say sources told him he's expected to miss Game 1. ""I'm told the Mavs are treating him day-to-day.""

He also mentioned that calf strains are typically 7 days at least. (which we've known) https://t.co/WqjdnC20i4",1514673131033702407,HGrahamNFL,1918854229
"Sammy Watkins, Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb and Amari Rodgers. Have fun Aaron. https://t.co/LsOkFH6mua",1514667541645377540,HGrahamNFL,1918854229
Nothing I heard here was new information. Shams said he's expected to miss Game 1 because a Grade 1 calf strain is typically 7-10 days. We've known that for days. I think Luka misses Game 1 and plays Game 2. #MFFL https://t.co/JqXb58jHtX,1514665984954667016,HGrahamNFL,1918854229
