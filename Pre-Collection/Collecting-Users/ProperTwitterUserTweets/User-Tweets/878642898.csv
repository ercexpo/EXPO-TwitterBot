Sox should try scoring some runs imo,1514688439827927053,Noahs_ark_2x2,878642898
Leury Garcia hasn’t done a single thing well and yet he finds his way into the lineup every day,1514673902600929292,Noahs_ark_2x2,878642898

The White Sox have absolutely hammered the baseball tonight. Robbie Ray is lucky he didn’t give up 12 runs,1514428638057299969,Noahs_ark_2x2,878642898
"It’s only been 2 innings, but how many times last year did we see Keuchel locating pitches as well as he has so far tonight? Very encouraging",1514397679039647744,Noahs_ark_2x2,878642898
Sox were all over Ray in that first inning. Just some tough luck,1514395412223778817,Noahs_ark_2x2,878642898
I hope the Dodgers lose the perfect game. Unforgivable move by Dave Roberts,1514322220193001472,Noahs_ark_2x2,878642898
Ain’t no way Dave Roberts just pulled Kershaw after 7 perfect innings. I’m sick.,1514321435128258561,Noahs_ark_2x2,878642898
