"Johnnie Davis makes zero sense if you think the current core is good enough be contenders. In that case your drafting for fit.

If Spurs don’t have that type of foundation yet, they need to keep taking swings at BPA from players 6’5”+ regardless of position. https://t.co/03Bno1XL2c",1514697910063087628,EricSal_7,4632765620
Jabari Smith Is destined to be a Spur.,1514662741482606600,EricSal_7,4632765620
"I was pointing out that regardless of where Spurs pick in top 10, they should be able to draft a really good player that can help immediately. https://t.co/ebDcktFBBy",1514589775658954754,EricSal_7,4632765620
"It’s 1 game. Yes we can point out he had an off night riddled with foul trouble, but by no means is this game indicative of who Dejounte is as a player moving forward. 

He had a great season where he turned the corner into an All Star. Can’t draw much from last night. https://t.co/Qhd1ifPTiq",1514579388582481926,EricSal_7,4632765620
"Best case draft addition with their top 10 pick: Paolo Banchero, Jabari Smith, Jaden Ivey

Worse case: Keegan Murray, Tari Eason, Johnnie Davis, Benedict Mathurin, Jalen Duren

Spurs should add at least one player that can start or play a big role immediately come June 23rd.",1514577362049982469,EricSal_7,4632765620
"Need Devin to get stronger and more confident to throw his body around to help out on/off ball on D and the boards more. 

Same for Primo. 

It’s only up from here. https://t.co/XKSFXchwvd",1514463397106135044,EricSal_7,4632765620
"Which players do you think played their last game as a Spur? 

High roster turnover is probably going to keep happening until they gain relevant contending traction.",1514457558626582532,EricSal_7,4632765620
"Spurs were out rebounded 56-36.

This was an issue all season due to their smaller personnel ( and weak frontcourt) and THE major reason why their defensive rating was very mediocre and underwhelming. Luckily, they are far from done when it comes to building a team.",1514456176695644161,EricSal_7,4632765620
"20.3 % chance at a top 4 pick is now for real. 

I’m stoked.",1514454654955962369,EricSal_7,4632765620
"Fuel for the off-season for the entire organization top to bottom. It’s time to keep building. 

Spurs are far from being a final product in this new direction. 

Can’t wait til May 17th and June 23rd.",1514453947003588613,EricSal_7,4632765620
