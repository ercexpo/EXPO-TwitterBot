"I took a lot of photos ⁦@wvfutbol⁩ #CapitalCup this weekend. Rain, snow, sleet, and hail (sometimes all at the same time) didn’t stop the games. The #ShawneeSports complex staff and facilities are top notch, which allowed games to continue. ⁦https://t.co/wLglPiGuOR",1514229071949045761,drkrmdvlpmnt,2516496584
"1990 and 2022 - Lockout 
1990 and 2022 - Reds, uncharacteristically, start on the road because of delayed start to season
1990 and 2022 - Reds start the season with a win
1990 (and 2022?) - @Reds are wire to wire “world champions of the world,” which is my fave @robdibble49 quote",1512429284253655045,drkrmdvlpmnt,2516496584

Ever wondered what would happen if you took Sarah Palin out of the oven too early? https://t.co/O5PlM76FUF,1511471380738494466,drkrmdvlpmnt,2516496584
"I stopped at House of Hops for some supplies on the way home, and by the time I ate dinner, it was time to watch basketball. It’s just a photo of the back of my camera. I haven’t taken them off the card yet, but it looks like I may have captured bat and ball contact! https://t.co/bPwJGJif52",1511390204350894080,drkrmdvlpmnt,2516496584
I went out to photograph the local high school softball team. I got this close to getting bat on ball contact. It’s my goal every time out shooting baseball or softball. https://t.co/vclqfgw4Uw,1510609065042456580,drkrmdvlpmnt,2516496584
My way too early (and probably unrealistic) World Cup group predictions. I can’t wait!  I’ve already got my leave on the calendar for @USMNT group matches. https://t.co/aoT3T9TqjL,1509950075291811845,drkrmdvlpmnt,2516496584

"I had fun doing a blind trade with @EricsCards, and I want to try it again. I’ll send you this card, and you send back something that you think I’ll like to complete the trade. Reds are my PC. I’ll like the claim and send a DM to get your address to confirm it’s yours. https://t.co/n1YDqDApSc",1508935227892244480,drkrmdvlpmnt,2516496584
