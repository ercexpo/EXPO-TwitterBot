You hear that? That’s not a storm warning and no one’s watching the part of that SpongeBob episode where Squidward screams out the perfect bubble. That’s the sound of a thousand Snyder bros screeching like wounded beasts as they realize that the Snyderverse ain’t coming back. https://t.co/uSwXZ0YoV1,1514746380551610370,BigBrother1988,30031117
"You know Sony could’ve just kept it and released it in August. Then again, the timing is interesting because this is when Sony’s deal with Netflix kicks in (after NWH and GB: Afterlife debut on STARZ, Sony’s releases will be exclusively on Netflix with a window deal in place) https://t.co/XR4NJN7sbo",1514723100818128898,BigBrother1988,30031117
Sting’s “The Windmills of Your Mind” from The Thomas Crown Affair remake and Alien Ant Farm’s “Smooth Criminal” https://t.co/2GzJ5M3sGD,1514683125523230722,BigBrother1988,30031117
Well….at least it’s not another 6 1/2 minute braggadocio session. https://t.co/UocQNOJQR9,1514679597585125387,BigBrother1988,30031117
"*sigh* I mean….on the one hand, at least it’s not an American remake because we rarely succeed at it these days. On the other hand, the original film’s a modern classic so why have a remake in the first place? https://t.co/42B6h3VKXC",1514450996914704384,BigBrother1988,30031117
"Oof! Time to get everything they had on there and start putting it on HBO Max, a hub for everything. https://t.co/ZDQtqVEf70",1514449909977649158,BigBrother1988,30031117
"If Spike Lee’s “NYC Epicenters” has taught me anything, it’s to NEVER underestimate the resilience of a New Yorker because it’ll always yield surprising results. Prime example: ONE NEW YORKER did what NYPD couldn’t do…spot a shooter and help bring him to justice. What a town! https://t.co/wns6vXfu3t",1514429011002368000,BigBrother1988,30031117
"Marky Mark, He done told you wrong. Easter weekend is not just for movies for church folks but also movies for kids &amp; families and I’m pretty certain there’s a fast blue rodent and his twin-tailed friend that they’re flocking to see. Oh, and that wizard movie but mostly those 2. https://t.co/80GnpQTvLS",1514427724663857152,BigBrother1988,30031117
"Aside from being potentially MORE rage-inducing than “Kills”, the only other thing that could enrage me is pulling a bait ending. If this is the last one ever, make sure Michael stays dead. Malek Akkad, make sure Michael stays dead. We don’t want no more after “Ends”. https://t.co/9X8ivksJci",1514384807400198147,BigBrother1988,30031117
"Too many people will be busy seeing Sonic 2, EEAAO and Ambulance to care anyway. https://t.co/VRVxv066Md",1514262558462595072,BigBrother1988,30031117
