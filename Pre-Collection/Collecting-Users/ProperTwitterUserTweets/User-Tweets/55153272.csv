If the falcons trade @GradyJarrett then I will officially not have a jersey of an active player for next year. We already lost @M_Ryan02 @juliojones_11 @CalvinRidley1 (sort of) @TG3II https://t.co/VPy1z6zs6h,1506247483382509568,trippwarrick,55153272
Crazy how much can change in less than a year. It is going to be a long year unless we hit on a lot of draft picks. https://t.co/h8bxuSaF9r,1506043890738110467,trippwarrick,55153272
I love the way he interacted with the fans at every game. We traveled for some of the road games and would always enjoy watching @ceeflashpee84 playing catch with fans before every game (home and away) https://t.co/XdqOhrowdX,1505529219182440448,trippwarrick,55153272
If I am Matt Ryan I wait until the Falcons pay me the bonus then I demand a trade. Would love to see him back but the way the whole Watson situation was handled makes you wonder if he will be back this year.,1505527675372425219,trippwarrick,55153272
Really happy to see you coming back! #RiseUp https://t.co/zEPp9qNT4E,1505319760132775946,trippwarrick,55153272
I am in this picture and will be in the one they take next year. #RiseUp https://t.co/WT3dscKwDB,1504588356356919300,trippwarrick,55153272

Falcons have holes on offensive line and across the whole defense. Instead of trading or pursing play makers in these areas during free agency we decided to go all in on a QB and gamble the future. Yeah that sounds about rightâ€¦ https://t.co/JkIn7Tmhr3,1504468822216134656,trippwarrick,55153272
I would love to see an overtime where the bengals win the toss and score a TD that ends it,1487924175486566405,trippwarrick,55153272
