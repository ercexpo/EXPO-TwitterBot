"NHL bc NYR, MLB bc NYM 

If Knicks were decent, theyâ€™d be close to NHL. In early 2010s, the Melo years. I was as big of Knicks fan as I was Rangers, but these days. Knicks just set me up for disappointment https://t.co/E3swgFN6dN",1514410122092683267,LouieBellina,2941029263
"Prob for best. Lines pretty set, he can start fresh in the summer after he signs a team friendly new contract. 

Hopefully will have a top 9 role next year. Panarins RW? https://t.co/rJzqD3oDeM",1514344734294253574,LouieBellina,2941029263
"Clinched a playoff spot, 4 years later https://t.co/lxZAG3vD8R",1513208421885095938,LouieBellina,2941029263
"The Rangers not having a 1st round pick 4 years in a row between 2012-2016, is why they had to rebuild 

Once Staal and Girardi started losing it, they didnâ€™t have viable kids ready to step in 

They tried to compensate by signing/trading for Dmen past there prime",1512863749073514505,LouieBellina,2941029263
"Trading 1st round picks for veterans past there prime or expiring doesnâ€™t make you better 

Hockey trades at the deadline(aka Copp and Vatrano build depth) and are more worth it and 1st round picks will maintain success level https://t.co/4vhWlJvAm6",1512861878514589704,LouieBellina,2941029263
This made me tear up https://t.co/fumIUA0E0D,1512608074841964557,LouieBellina,2941029263
"We did sweep Tampa ðŸ‘€â€¦ haha. In all seriousness, please let Carolina not loose again haha https://t.co/aV0ydtzpYN",1511758948084465671,LouieBellina,2941029263
This is actually really impressive https://t.co/eCkIR24reP,1511695340092669955,LouieBellina,2941029263
"Kakko, Laf, Chytil, Othmann, Kratsov, and Cuylle combined with Fox, Miller, Schneider, Jones, Lundkvist, and Robertson and Shesty in net. 

This should be the first year of what is a long window of playoff appearances and runs. 

The veterans around this core will change",1511572599444324356,LouieBellina,2941029263
"What I liked about NYR today. Schneider needs to stay in line up. And  Braun. By far best performance we got from a bottom pair all season 

Top 6 should not be changed the rest of season through playoffs. Next year, Laf and Kakko need to be top 6 and play through there struggles",1511572098069803010,LouieBellina,2941029263
