"I think it says something that Dave Roberts pitching moves with direction from FO have been so suspect over the years that many of us, including me, immediately jumped him for pulling Kershaw during the perfecto. In retrospect the reasoning was sound with Kershaw calling the shot",1514490343370067969,BitOBaca,41700031
I feel like today is officially #Dodgers season because all I am doing is bitching about them when they win 😂,1514380882454274051,BitOBaca,41700031
Tommy Lasorda would have forfeited the game before he would have ever pulled Kershaw,1514378228525264897,BitOBaca,41700031
"And, don’t come at me with thus Johan Santana talk, if Kershaw wanted out he goes out for 8th and if ANYTHING doesn’t feel right “health wise” not “stuff wise” he pulls himself out and it’s all good. This is being overly cautious……but what the hell do I know ?",1514377853327974402,BitOBaca,41700031
I prefer my pitchers to chase immortality……but maybe that’s just me,1514377163197190145,BitOBaca,41700031
"Well, evidently I jumped the gun on the Dave Roberts slander……again. 
Kershaw told Roberts he wanted to go out for the 7th but wanted to stop at 80-85 pitches….Kershaw on his slider in 6th and 7th innings, “it was terrible. It was time. It was the right decision.” Ok whatever",1514376766252466180,BitOBaca,41700031
I find myself loving that the Giants were bunting and stealing bases in the 6th last night and hating that the Dodgers are pulling legends with perfect games……so yeah ! That’s where I am 🤦‍♂️,1514325615377276929,BitOBaca,41700031
🛫 wheels up…..thank goodness or else I might have continued with the rant,1514325071686516740,BitOBaca,41700031
"And, if he agreed with decision, that raises more questions with me……",1514324476040728578,BitOBaca,41700031
"You run Kershaw out there until he gives up a hit…..and then you rest him for two weeks if need be…..13 perfectos in 140 years…..I only change my stance if Kershaw says he asked out, or 100 percent agreed with decision",1514324303801733120,BitOBaca,41700031
