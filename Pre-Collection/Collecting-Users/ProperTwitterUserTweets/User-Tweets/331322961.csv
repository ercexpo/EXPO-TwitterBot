True but Didi was chosen to the be the next SS so Yankees were willing to be patient. IKF is a stop gap SS we all know it. If Peraza keeps taking bring that kid up! https://t.co/mQS6GvAmK6,1514595969773436929,jctucker_3,331322961

We really are going to see a different lineup each day. Hopefully the juggling of spots in the order and playing field positions don't ruin rhythm for the players. https://t.co/OCkGMyi0Rc,1514332802581348355,jctucker_3,331322961
Go back in time and not lose to the Mavericks in the Finals. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è that‚Äôs one he shouldn‚Äôt have lost. Losing to SA a few years later whatever losing to the Steph &amp; KD warriors is whatever. But that series against Dallas changed everything for me. https://t.co/Z3GYgaiEJC,1514230946106540034,jctucker_3,331322961
Man hicks is in the lineup and Judge has to play his position and taking at bats from Gallo. Oh goodie https://t.co/VUc4pJykGa,1513954227571212288,jctucker_3,331322961
