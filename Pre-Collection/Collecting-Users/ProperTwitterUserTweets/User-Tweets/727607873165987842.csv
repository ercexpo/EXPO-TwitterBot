I would feel a lot better about this team if we had another reliable starter because the offense is going to be fine Jack flaherty is not dependable health-wise #STLCards,1505660218377748480,LEE_STAR_KAT,727607873165987842
My only interest right now is the starting rotation can't win without pitching that should be the focus right now that's the truth #stlcards,1505588856975986693,LEE_STAR_KAT,727607873165987842
