Currently in Sedona to experience some vortex energy and good vibes before a weekend of debauchery… just kidding. Well sorta. It’s @BTS_twt #PTD_ON_STAGE_LV after all 😂 https://t.co/XjwZ6PGSR4,1514719242381262858,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
"I walked around Grand Canyon yesterday with Peri, Bojangles and Winnie peeking out of my backpack. Sometimes I feel like I’m @BTS_twt #Seokjin. I don’t care abt looking silly for fun 😂 We could be BFFs really. https://t.co/Tix4zYkS8K",1514657950933000192,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
This week is a test to how much energy I actually have. Been #namjooning and hiking since Monday and today I’m gonna check out Sedona for vortices before heading to #Borahaegas for @BTS_twt #PTD_ON_STAGE_LV. https://t.co/G02BgumZyH,1514615650550910990,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
"While going around Southwest, I found the perfect earrings for my @BTS_twt #PTD_ON_STAGE_LasVegas outfit! I feel like the universe drew me to those jewelry stands and said “you need this” 😂 https://t.co/eUYLciREEC",1514453900471930881,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
"If I see someone near me trying to throw something @BTS_twt cart, I will block it with my boobs. Then I will stare you down and it will get really awkward…. So just don’t. https://t.co/vKp60hTqAT",1514442122631340034,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
Today’s #Namjooning is at the Grand Canyon. It was super crowded. You’d think @BTS_twt was here… maybe? 😂 https://t.co/Ht6CLiuReM,1514400616231190531,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
Yes!!! At least @jewellasvegas knew they messed up with that fake DJ from Day 2 and hired an actual DJ who knew the assignment. Can’t wait to go to the @BTS_twt after party #Borahaegas https://t.co/Zz49c45P7O,1514323825294462981,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
"My former boss, my fave, txt me this am abt old workplace crossing his mind and how happy he was to be out of there. I said me too. I may be paid much less now but I’m stress free. That’s the best part of the job. @BTS_twt gave me the strength to walk away… and leave a banana 😂 https://t.co/ZlLEVCzKaK",1514309788703739905,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
"I’ve always been supportive of Native American art. I remember last time I was in Navajo land, there were road side stands selling jewelry. Stopped &amp; bought some goodies. Turquoise necklace set and abalone shell pendant. I used @BTS_twt pouch fr @mikrokosmosland to protect them💜 https://t.co/o7xiimqb76",1514047299487469569,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
"Ok last stop for the day, #HorseshoeBend. My fear of heights was very much challenged here. The wind blowing and then standing on the edge of a cliff to take pictures…. #insane. But this is very much @BTS_twt #Namjooning worthy 😃💜 https://t.co/69ySDcz0zn",1514041090399113217,KookieBae26,953445512249667584
