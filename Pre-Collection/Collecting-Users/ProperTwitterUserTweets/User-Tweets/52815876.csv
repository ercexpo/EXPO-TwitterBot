Well on the bright side… the Blue Jays are undefeated against the Yankees in any game this season that they scored at least 1 run.,1514812351639293960,pucker7,52815876

"The Florida Panthers have had 27.4% of their games reach overtime (20 of 73). They have won 70% of those games (14-6).

Without OT/SO, their points % drops from .753 to .658.

"Honestly, I kind of hope Knies goes back to college and the Leafs use the contract spot this year on Ben Meyers. 

Around this time next year the Leafs could sign Knies then have Meyers and him in sheltered roles on the 3rd/4th lines.",1513567391623561218,pucker7,52815876
