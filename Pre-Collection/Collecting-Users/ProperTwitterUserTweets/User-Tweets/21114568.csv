"So we get a featurette on the IMAX cameras, convincing me to see the film in @IMAX, and NOW we get a reason to see it in @DolbyCinema too?!

"A sobering realization that to win the Tourney, SO many stars need to align. 

It also showcases how we as fans can be TERRIBLE human beings for getting mad at kids giving their blood, sweat, &amp; tears for the love of the game. Some of those IG/Twitter comments? Woof. Do better. https://t.co/5I0gBPizDH",1514643845622997004,ChaseDunnette,21114568
