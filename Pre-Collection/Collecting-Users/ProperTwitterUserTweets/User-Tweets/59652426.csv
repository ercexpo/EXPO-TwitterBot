The @Dodgers out here trying to show Rob Manfred some tricks on how to ruin baseball https://t.co/9TC40oJ0QW,1514323831044853769,RealUncleRob,59652426
What if the Tigers just went out and scored more than 5 runs in a baseball game today… #DetroitRoots #tigers,1514290494087602185,RealUncleRob,59652426
What a rip off. I’ll do it for $7k https://t.co/ppgtGZrZe2,1514270072226861062,RealUncleRob,59652426
This is exactly what this website was made for https://t.co/Lnj9Anh1Ur,1514227689435054080,RealUncleRob,59652426
I feel comfortable at this point saying Javy Baez is the greatest Javier to ever wear a Tigers uniform #DetroitRoots #tigers,1513940553926328328,RealUncleRob,59652426
Got that Bobby Higginson swag turned up to a billion today #DetroitRoots #tigers https://t.co/zG3AixkPdC,1513875579753439238,RealUncleRob,59652426
Todays a great day for someone other than Javy Baez to drive in some runs for the Tigers. #DetroitRoots #Tigers,1513869471714320386,RealUncleRob,59652426
Only the 4th game but it is quite surprising how much the offense has struggled so far #DetroitRoots #tigers,1513658559363522570,RealUncleRob,59652426
The top 4 in this White Sox lineup is just lethal #ChangeTheGame #DetroitRoots,1513217134553448460,RealUncleRob,59652426
