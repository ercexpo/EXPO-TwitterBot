So many others I thought did, only to find out how shallow they truly are. Not Murf tho, stand up guy and friend! This brought a much needed tear of joy ❤️ https://t.co/3PJ8k4NJcE",1514342979091247104,PeoplezPen,1228429394

"People just out here with no inkling of their own hypocrisy. Discussions can no longer be had, either conform to same beliefs or we can’t be friends. Shameful how life has become due to social media.",1513974782546612237,PeoplezPen,1228429394
"Waited? Been speaking this for years now. And the derogatory ‘bootlicker’ term appears to have escaped your grasp. You followed me and really have no clue who I am, what I do, or where I’m from.

"This makes zero sense, as I’m only speaking about where I live. But thanks, Rob Waziak, for dropping in to preach. https://t.co/RGClIleJH8",1513945291489267715,PeoplezPen,1228429394
"Lest we forget how days like today are born. You reap what you sow.
