So many on twitter are comparing DK to Frank Clark. Thereâ€™s a major difference to me. DK has a much much higher ceiling than Frank ever had. Frank wasnâ€™t worth the money he wanted. DK is worth every penny. #Seahawks,1511555148862029824,MauiSeahawk,95126211
Gotta love @steveaustinBSR face after this epic fail. ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/7PP9x3b0dH,1510853021583831041,MauiSeahawk,95126211
Perfect ending to Coach Ks career! #Final4,1510454962219716609,MauiSeahawk,95126211
Who here believes there is any chance BWagz deal is actually 5 years or 65million? Love the man but like a 2 year deal at most.,1509638305381433353,MauiSeahawk,95126211
"This fucking guyâ€¦ by entitled, he means people wonâ€™t just accept their place in as the worker bees and keep their mouth shut. This guy is the problem with the world! https://t.co/XmoVL5ZuaU",1509376150740488196,MauiSeahawk,95126211
"Listening to @jtheaps9 makes me think the #Seahawks will eventually trade DK. Not because they want to but because someone is going to come with so much value, they wonâ€™t be able to say no. Is there an acceptable value to fans?",1508867169097945090,MauiSeahawk,95126211
Totally unrealistic but man I would love this draft for the #Seahawks https://t.co/cK5sAhpsTs,1507599438444867588,MauiSeahawk,95126211
I donâ€™t what it is but Gonzaga just canâ€™t get over the hump and win a championship. My first thought is the WCC being so weak that the team can never get enough solid competition before the tournament. Then they meet up against tougher teams and lose. It sucks to watch.,1507170758069420052,MauiSeahawk,95126211
Iâ€™m still 100% on board with bringing in @Kaepernick7 to the #Seahawks to compete and then waiting to draft a QB til next year.,1506060838330789888,MauiSeahawk,95126211
After the Panthers trade or draft another QBâ€¦..                                                            A source close to Baker has told me Baker would rather not play in the NFL then play for the #Seahawks ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/gf3A7d6CMr,1506050890943590403,MauiSeahawk,95126211
