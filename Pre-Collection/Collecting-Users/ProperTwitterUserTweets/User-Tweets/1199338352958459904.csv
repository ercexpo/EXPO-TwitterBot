"The team to watch to move up if Malik Willis is available at 8 is the Pittsburgh Steelers. They could send a package similar to what Chi sent NYG to move up 9 spots,  Giants got a 1st (20 ovr) and 5th ( in 21) and a 1st (7 ovr) and 4th ( in 22) Should ATL trade back? Or Stay at 8",1511508100251111428,KickitwithCrow,1199338352958459904
"Just wouldn‚Äôt make much sense For the Falcons to go WR at 8 with how deep this draft is at WR. They should get one of these top Defenders in the draft. FIX THE DEFENSE. Yea TF has made some nice moves on D with R Evans, L Carter, and C Heyward but still need help at all 3 levels",1511498800912809990,KickitwithCrow,1199338352958459904
