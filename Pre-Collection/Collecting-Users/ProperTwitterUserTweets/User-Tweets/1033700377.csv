"WR's are going to terrified looking for TWlll and Joker over the top...

Catching the ball across the middle is a gauntlet in Detroit now.",1514588158821863428,DumasMike,1033700377
"Every minute I think about it I'm getting so hype about this Joker signing... I feel like I got Louis Delmas 2.0 back in the building.

Joker is a wreckless cannon ball lowering the boom in the secondary and I'm here for it. I'm going to cop that 7era jersey as soon as it drops.",1514577408401227776,DumasMike,1033700377
"DeShon Elliott aka Joker

Tracy Walker aka TWlll

The hardest hitting safety tandem in the NFC is about to set them tone for this defense in 2022.

This changes all my expectations if Joker stays healthy.",1514565251039207429,DumasMike,1033700377
Could have sworn the refs saved your running back at quarterback with that delay of game no call? https://t.co/Luf5EEx2yM,1514437884555714568,DumasMike,1033700377

"Man I love how this team is built... 1 year deals to scrappy players with no money  guaranteed in the future  so they have to fight for their next meal. And rookies coming in watching that same work ethic... All under contract.

This ain't the SOL...",1514397006437011463,DumasMike,1033700377
"This defense gonna be tough bro we got Beard and Elliot from that Ravens defense helping these young boys bro.

Brad Holmes is being way undervalued in free agency at this point.",1514391077117173768,DumasMike,1033700377
