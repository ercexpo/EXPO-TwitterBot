"QUESTION: If you race a longer distance (ie: half marathon or marathon) &amp; you manage to break your PR on a shorter distance (5K, 10K, Half), do you count the new PR even though the race wasn't for that distance? #Running #BibChat #RunChat",1513932169252642825,ARunnersResolve,1111775238864416768

Ran a great 7 miles this morning. Added a small change to this route to get in a particular hill twice during this out and back. Nice to get in a good run to start the day. #Running #Fitness #Training #BibChat #RunChat #ShokzSquad https://t.co/oYZ7HbBONO,1513165385213874177,ARunnersResolve,1111775238864416768
