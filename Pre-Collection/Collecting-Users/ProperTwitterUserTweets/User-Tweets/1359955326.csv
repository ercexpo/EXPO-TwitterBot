"WB/DC wants to revamp under new management. They want another Kevin Feige. That means you need someone innovative who doesn't use an industry standard approach. Sony &amp; Fox tried already.🤷🏿‍♂️
Also, I don't think Zack Snyder needs that role. He excels at DIRECTING contained projects. https://t.co/OC66WvsmXe",1514691756163579905,EmansReviews,1359955326
"I've never understood people's fascination with Daniel Radcliffe being Wolverine. Why? Because he's short? 🤨 I know he can act but Harry Potter ain't intimidating nobody. 😅 Stop this.

Man I love what @donaldglover has created with #AtlantaFX. The only thing to make this world complete would be a return of the Chappelle Show and the Boondocks. ✊🏿 https://t.co/wCeDzyDVDm,1513687721901973504,EmansReviews,1359955326
"I think @MarvelStudios could afford to release the #ThorLoveAndThunder trailer at the end of #DoctorStrange2 via post-credit scene. (Worked for Spider-Man: No Way Home)

There's social media, word of mouth, commercials, &amp; radio. 2 months is enough time to promote a Marvel movie. https://t.co/ImLCmfgBXa",1513604770375819266,EmansReviews,1359955326
"Great interview on the reparations episode from #AtlantaFX 👍🏿

What questions are you still wondering about for #MoonKnight? 🤔 https://t.co/PSs8u4g7jy,1513269893294182411,EmansReviews,1359955326
"If fans really enjoyed #Morbius so much more than critics, I think they would've showed that with their money. 🤔 I think people were just interested in seeing how bad the movie was based on early reviews. Remember, ""not that bad"" still means it's bad. 🤷🏿‍♂️
