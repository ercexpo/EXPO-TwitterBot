"Congrats to the @Timberwolves‚Ä¶but man, that celebration was a little over the top for making the playoffs.  I would have thought they won the championship and Pat Bev was Finals MVP! ü§£",1514100017329410053,JB_DenverSports,315349067
The 2-seed vs 7-seed matchups in this years playoffs are probably the most entertaining in this years @NBAPlayoffs2022,1514097647103066112,JB_DenverSports,315349067
"This is the definition of playing with house money. First playoffs in the Jokic era in which there is no pressure, no expectations by the majority of unbiased fans or media members.  Honestly, I like it that way. Hopefully the #Nuggets play free &amp; shoot lights out, gunna need it. https://t.co/LEqgLDsGX9",1514069103698350080,JB_DenverSports,315349067
"Embiid, Giannis, &amp; Jokic are all worthy MVP candidates. Obviously I am bias towards Jokic, &amp; feel he deserves it. But if Giannis or Embiid won it, I wouldn‚Äôt be upset by that. Those two dudes played at an MVP level. I prefer to prop these guys up instead of tearing them down.",1513721064836108295,JB_DenverSports,315349067
"Tony Brothers was doing the #Mavs a favor when he gave Luca Doncic his 16th technical, &amp; subsequently suspended for the last game. Instead, #Mavs have it rescinded, Luca Doncic plays &amp; gets injured, late in a meaningless game, &amp; now might miss the playoffs or be compromised.üòß",1513555425668464641,JB_DenverSports,315349067
"#Nuggets fans, listen to the 49:30 mark and forward to hear Ryen Russillo and Bill Simmons give their explanation of why they are voting for Nikola Jokic for MVP. Great listen! üëáüèª https://t.co/O9Y7Wy40Cd",1513541968512516099,JB_DenverSports,315349067
