One of the greats. RIP https://t.co/tAt3vlTCJs,1513965033952362502,JValladares58,631531833
3 runs is nothing! Let’s get it going offense,1513939284503535624,JValladares58,631531833
Barnes in the 6th huh. Interesting,1513650340524089346,JValladares58,631531833
Still can’t believe I was suspended from twitter for telling someone to slap themselves. These algorithms are SAWFT,1512981337950633985,JValladares58,631531833
Tough loss. Offense needs to get in rhythm and step up more. Very early but I have my concerns. This month is going to be a grind,1512933623267303425,JValladares58,631531833
I don’t think it’s been said enough but thank god for Nate Eovaldi. With Sale struggling to stay healthy he’s really stepped up as the ace we needed. He’ll always be a legend for that performance in Game 4 of the ‘18 World Series. Thankful for Nasty Nate,1512503608725622790,JValladares58,631531833
