A microcosm of John Henry cutting costs to not pay his own players and buy other pro sports teams. https://t.co/xw3xSGgaE2,1514745621328060419,PatBradley_,938063017

"Itâ€™s so funny to me how hard Yankee fans defend John Sterling. Just let it go. An old guy is getting old and making mistakes. Itâ€™s embarrassing, itâ€™s hilarious, but itâ€™s fine â€” and itâ€™s not the end of the world. The more anyone defends it the dumber it looks ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/AnpxwGPTJd",1514690410311991298,PatBradley_,938063017

Iâ€™d rather John Henry sell the team. Go fund your expansion elsewhere. https://t.co/P8ga0Sqp3h,1514351580593770502,PatBradley_,938063017
"LeBronâ€™s still trying to be the GOAT

Stephâ€™s never won a Finals MVP

If Giannis only ever wins once, how does that affect his legacy?

If Kawhi doesnâ€™t get healthy and make a run in LA or elsewhere itâ€™s such a huge what if. 3 titles is a different tier.

Never settle. https://t.co/orx3RX9EQN",1514351020763144194,PatBradley_,938063017
