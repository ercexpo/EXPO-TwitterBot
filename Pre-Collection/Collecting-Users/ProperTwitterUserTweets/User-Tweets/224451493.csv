What I'm trying to say is; I want the Sonic movies to be a big fun animated action/adventure franchise for future movies with a spin off film or series or two.,1514767535660535811,MesousaGaby,224451493
"Like, the only animated franchise going on hard at the moment is the Despicable Me/Minions franchise and frankly...I think people know the mascots more than the movies themselves.

In other words, it really shouldn't have been a franchise.",1514767189466914818,MesousaGaby,224451493
"And while emulating Marvel might actually be sort of a bad idea, I think Sonic's movies could pull it off because I can eventually see it be as big as the Marvel movies, but in the animation medium.",1514766965872766976,MesousaGaby,224451493
"It's not like there's lots of material of other Sonic media to emulate from.

And yeah, I'm aware Sega could become rather grumpy with rights issues, but they DO need to move on and let that go, otherwise, it could eventually hurt the movies.",1514766296088518662,MesousaGaby,224451493
"I mean, Carrey is in his 60's. You could argue that they would have gone with a younger actor, but uh...he's not the star of the franchise. In a way, he's sort of an add-on. It's supposed to be Sonic's franchise, not Robotnik's.

People need to live with that.",1514765687042023424,MesousaGaby,224451493
"""But...what about Jim Carrey's Robotnik? The character is too pivotal to the franchise.""

I'm probably gonna get flack on this, but I like the idea of the Robotnik name being intercheagable to other possible villains, weather they're human or not.",1514765464869781510,MesousaGaby,224451493
"Think of the Knuckles spin-off being a test to integrade the other Sonic characters, and if it does well enough, movies past the third one could experiment around a little bit.",1514765093740888070,MesousaGaby,224451493
"That, and also the fact that we don't really have a big action/adventure animated franchise. After the third movie,  don't be too surprised if it goes through a second evolution and that's how we see more of the other characters from that franchise.

That's what I'm hoping.",1514764909640302593,MesousaGaby,224451493
"I honestly think that after the first trilogy of movies, they'll have Sonic, Tails and Knuckles start to have bigger adventures, and they indeed won't need the human characters afterwards.",1514764540705136645,MesousaGaby,224451493
I think the reason why I'm so excited about a possible Sonic Cinematic Universe is because the Sonic franchise always was the more experiemntal franchise in terms of making up over the top and big stories that making them be epic animated action movies just feels right.,1514764100454203398,MesousaGaby,224451493
