"Grizz Gaming went away from the ""simple"" pick n roll offense that gave them a double - digit lead. Then, made the offense more complex, and the Hornets lead. 

A lot of dribbling with no agenda right now. Absolutely insane. Grizz just retook the lead.",1514784184522326019,bsmart21,609742712
"Man, Grizz Gaming collapsing right before our eyes... again.",1514783586070654980,bsmart21,609742712
"Grizz Gaming, whom got off to a hot start against Hornets Venom still leads 34-30 at the half.
