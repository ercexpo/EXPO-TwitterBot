I think some of you should retire off Twitter. Trading Deebo goes against everything you say you want from this organization in terms of keeping its home grown talent. @19problemz https://t.co/PviP5s2ri4,1506764892069531648,49erRoss,1329146490162331648
"Since the Shanahan era started in 2017, the 49ers have been in the minus in turnover differential all but one year which was in 2019. Whatever the plan is moving forward, they have got to improve with taking care of the football and forcing turnovers.

I am convinced the Rams are playing Madden while everybody else playing real football. Unlimited trades and cap every year ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://t.co/gdjIIkh8q6,1505319001575944192,49erRoss,1329146490162331648
Welp. Not thrilled about losing Tomlinson. I knew he would get paid but I didn‚Äôt think it would be to a team like the Jets. https://t.co/2M0yxoFC23,1503432079421321221,49erRoss,1329146490162331648

The look on Niners fans faces to see Russel Wilson traded. He owned us. I will give him that. I just hope Seattle doesn‚Äôt have an upgrade up their sleeves. #Broncos #49ers #nfloffseason https://t.co/DOnnEhLJZY,1501270340063825926,49erRoss,1329146490162331648

"Why all this talk about @minakimes
Personally I think she‚Äôs dope.

I know what was said but the outrage is ridiculous. The outrage should be about the strong fan base Jimmy has. I bet it wouldn‚Äôt be a story if it was any other QB she was talking about.",1486792393726697473,49erRoss,1329146490162331648
