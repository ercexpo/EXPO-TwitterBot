This is great but they still need big men. Wynter will replace Sessoms and take the load off Pickett at PG. Funk is a shooter and should start at the two or three https://t.co/vhLHBUofhJ,1514673302127656963,AaronPYorke,28221763

I’m going to stay up all night thinking about this vote. Romeo was driving the Jonathan train but ends up voting Maryanne. But that doesn’t matter because Hai abandoned Lydia and Drea voted with him. Looks like Omar and his old tribe are running the game now #Survivor,1514483165082968064,AaronPYorke,28221763
"If this episode of #Survivor was any indication, the rest of the season should be bonkers. Hai was controlling everything and then lost his top ally. Omar pulling the strings like a mastermind",1514481237137760264,AaronPYorke,28221763
LOL my guy Rocks is really just playing his own game out there! I think I am rooting for him now. Unbelievable #Survivor https://t.co/R220dWgZsA,1514478041862447106,AaronPYorke,28221763
