I feel really bad cause as a person/mother of your child &amp; gf. Jenna does not deserve to be treated the way she does. But @ the same time she was being a real brat during pregnancy &amp; she's giving off how her parents always complained bout everything the other does! #unexpectedtlc,1513584515414777857,Alofaaaa,1669692902
