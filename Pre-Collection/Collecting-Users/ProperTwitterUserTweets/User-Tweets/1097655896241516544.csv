"Don't take for granted that it was IKF on second to start the inning...

The Yankees really don't have much speed on their team, and IKF is arguably their best baserunner and turned a potentially close play at the plate into an easy score...",1512539260771094535,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
"Josh Donaldson, one of the newest Yankees, drives in IKF, another of the newest Yankees in for the win!",1512538807870144512,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
"When a team signs a young 27 yr old in FA &amp; gives a ton of $ and yrs in the deal, its because they care about the realistic 6 or 7 great yrs, and the rest is gravy.
If you sign a guy like Judge at 30, his prime yrs are going to be much less but he still wants the same AAV as 1/2",1512473101958844426,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
"I don't think I'd go much higher than this if I'm NYY. 

We want to pay for future production, and realistically, 35M a yr from age 30 to 38 with a guy who has shown to be a bit injury prone, is a bit irresponsible... https://t.co/uCz7nqWJCL",1512472098228346887,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
"With Locastro sent to AAA, who's the Yankees' go-to pinch runner?",1511411743158947840,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
So the best move this off-season for the #Yankees was Randal Grichuk getting traded out of the division?,1507051332913532931,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
"Yes, the AL East is deep.

But anyone who says that NYY doesn't have a legitimate shot at winning it, are lying.

NYY roster stacks up with the rest of the teams, and IMHO are the best.

They've choked in big spots before, but we're just as good as the competition, if not better.",1505556812891934723,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
"Corey Seager, who was not the obvious #1 guy in this free agent class (and possibly even at his position) hit it big.

He signed a deal that is 40M shy of being DOUBLE the money of the next biggest deal this off-season.

He signed for 325M, and Kris Bryant, who was 2nd, got 182M.",1505554592054091780,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
"What happened to the massive deals?

Have the owners decided to offer less to players?

I understand it was a stacked class, but we had only one +185M deal in Seager, while guys like Freeman, Correa, Story, and others, who would've usually gotten +200M, did not.

Any guesses why?",1505553986568560646,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
"Trevor Story, who has been one of the best shortstop in the game for a few years now, got 140M/6yrs.

Fernando Tatis Jr. got 340M/14yrs after playing less than 162 games.

I'm not saying anything is right or wrong, it's just something interesting to think about.",1505553131035312134,_MarcusGuy,1097655896241516544
