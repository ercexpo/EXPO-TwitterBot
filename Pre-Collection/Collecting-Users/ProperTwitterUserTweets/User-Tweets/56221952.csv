I snagged another @backstop10 Sundberg bat for the collection yesterday. This 1986 Royals bat makes for my 13th different model and or color scheme. It also makes for my 15th overall bat of his. Its been a slow long process but the collection is really coming together nicely. https://t.co/SAZxS3iuEn,1509879959992610824,CLMCII,56221952

Always on the hunt for @MikeyY626 game stuff. I was able to add this little beauty to the always growing collection. I am still looking hard for a 2013 Dodgers game used bat and a 2000 Blue Jays LVS Spring Training used bat. Before you know it I will have a Museum lol. https://t.co/fwo70ckyj8,1486341951737765888,CLMCII,56221952
Sweet little pickup for the @MikeyY626 collection. I just added my 1st pair of cleats. These are a nice pair of 2013 Phillies cleats. The search continues for the next Young game used piece. Onward and upward. Happy New Year Everyone!! https://t.co/0KLhnsMocA,1478193291388719107,CLMCII,56221952

I was given a heads up to another @MikeyY626 jersey. I was able to pick it up and add it to the always growing collection. This jersey was used on May 4th 2008 at Oakland. He went 1 for 4 with a single to LF in the 1st inning. https://t.co/rqCV10jdBX,1408545937807532041,CLMCII,56221952
I absolutely love collecting @backstop10 game bats. I am happy to say that I own 12 of them. #12 is a 83'-85' LVS P72 that came in the mail today is from the 84' Brewers. My 85' Royals Rawlings bat is signed by the whole WS team. A career history in bats. Here are 10 of 12 Enjoy! https://t.co/EaybEUJzAm,1374172958130900992,CLMCII,56221952
"So I picked up a mannequin for my @MikeyY626 uniform. I am still waiting on the blue shoe laces, black tape, socks and belt to come in. This really turned out well. I may have to think about doing a Rangers uniform in the future. https://t.co/UyLQ1mbdrw",1370218806937849856,CLMCII,56221952
"Slowly finding @MikeyY626 team signed. 1997 UCSB Ball, 1998 Hagerstown Suns Ball, 1999 Dunedin Blue Jays Ball, 2000 Tennessee Smokies Bat. I am always on the hunt. So far 97 is the oldest signature I have. https://t.co/9mvR19JxFg",1354315967589920768,CLMCII,56221952
Twitter is banning us all who supported or still supports Donald Trump. They can ban us all but all they are doing is taking away our 1st amendment which is sad. Thing are going to happen that no one will like. People will die on both sides. A 2nd civil war is here.,1347745761388326912,CLMCII,56221952
