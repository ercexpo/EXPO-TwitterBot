Kole Calhoun is batting .077 on the year so far and with 0 outs and runners on 1st and 2nd with Ottani pitching with a 2-0 lead in the 2nd inning you don’t bunt him and move the runners??????????? Baseball is so trash now I don’t even understand these crap philosophies,1514768479550771203,GarretMJ,1257634970
Has a ranger pitcher gotten through the 1st inning without giving up a run this season? Just insane to me we can’t get 3 out without giving up at least a run lol,1514764276157796353,GarretMJ,1257634970
THE MLB IS NOW AN EMBARRASSMENT. Mark my words they will headed downhill if rules and calls that took place in extras at Globe Life continue to happen on major stages later in the year in big games,1513673111006285836,GarretMJ,1257634970
The rules in MLB are so messed up now that im on the verge of not even being a baseball fan anymore of anything other than college baseball,1513672240172343300,GarretMJ,1257634970
The Texas ranger pitching and defense looks like a single A baseball team. Sucks since we can actually score this year but can’t get basic outs and stop from making basic errors,1513660011913822217,GarretMJ,1257634970
I am pissed at Jason Kidd and everyone else should be too. Nobody else to blame in that situation knowing the pelicans were losing so bad at halftime. Should’ve put all the starters on the bench after halftime. Horrible decision even if nobody gets hurt the rest of the game,1513372310090223618,GarretMJ,1257634970

Rangers defense looks horrendous so far this year,1513215058473533442,GarretMJ,1257634970
Why do the rangers start a guy who had a 7+ ERA last season?? Jesus were doomed,1513213425572265989,GarretMJ,1257634970
Guess what bullpen lost another lead and game today? You guessed it the Texas Rangers!,1512910407584915465,GarretMJ,1257634970
