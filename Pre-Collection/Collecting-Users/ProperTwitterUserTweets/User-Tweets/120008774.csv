"#Raiders draft prediction:

I think Ziegler would like to even the blow to the draft capital, so I could see a pick swap of our 4th + next year's 2nd rounder for something in rd2. That way they have 2nd &amp; 3rd to use and still two 5ths (if I remember right).",1514432213303152647,pcarson81,120008774
