Hell of a win Wild! I am at my local bar here in Wisconsin and all they have for hockey is the Admirals. I just had the whole bar here cheering for the Wild! #mnwild,1514796853702758407,zekewill1980,124337059
Can’t pitch can’t hit just an ugly home stand to start the season. 2-4 is not a good way to start. #MNTwins,1514321148909027332,zekewill1980,124337059
Really bad home stand for the Twins to start the season here. If this continues you can say goodbye to Correa at the all star break. #MNTwins,1514320307946807298,zekewill1980,124337059
Not a good start for Paddack here. #MNTwins,1514292833632534532,zekewill1980,124337059
Timberwolves are going to win! I would of lost it if they would of lost this crap ass playin game. #NBA #RaisedByWolves,1514098223497060357,zekewill1980,124337059
For all you guys bitching about this game it shouldn’t even be happening. Wolves earned this damn 7th seed in the regular season over this Clippers team by 4 games. #NBA #RaisedByWolves https://t.co/25Lr1CDsry,1514087870180610052,zekewill1980,124337059
The NBA fucked up big time with this 7-10 seed play in bullshit. #NBA,1514086855179964419,zekewill1980,124337059
NBA can take their play in bullshit and shove the fucking thing. We earned the 7th seed over this Clippers team by 4 fucking games. #NBA #RaisedByWolves,1514084905780748289,zekewill1980,124337059
Just call the damn Twins game. It’s 7-1 it’s a damn loss. Sorry I am crabby tonight. #MNTwins,1514078638559444992,zekewill1980,124337059
I am so pissed at these Wolves players right now. This is how you want to play for Finch after his extension. Unreal. #RaisedByWolves,1514077441987330053,zekewill1980,124337059
