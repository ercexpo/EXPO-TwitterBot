Letâ€™s hope @steelers dont get desperate and reach for a safety like they did Edmunds in draft...that said they prob need to try to sign him #Steelers,1513494021104091150,SilverburghKane,942748113365692416
I really like Ronnie Harrison I think the #Steelers messed up if they didnâ€™t offer him a deal...cuz it sounds like Honey Badger is goin to Eagles...which makes no sense if he had trouble w #Chiefs fans then he doesnâ€™t stand a chance there,1513468620172636166,SilverburghKane,942748113365692416
People getting lost in the Schefter tweet...I get it was dumb but everybody needs to get back to remembering Haskins life ...instead of what one man said #Steelers,1512844800327827457,SilverburghKane,942748113365692416
Prayers to @dh_simba7 family man thatâ€™s terrible #Steelers ðŸ˜¢,1512807891245408264,SilverburghKane,942748113365692416

Well the Saints are def taking a QB round 1 ....letâ€™s hope #Steelers,1511086184709210119,SilverburghKane,942748113365692416
Twitter blows today nothing interesting ...the only thing that made me laugh or was interesting was @CamHeyward saying he was released by #Steelers,1510015219325710341,SilverburghKane,942748113365692416
