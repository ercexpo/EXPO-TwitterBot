"Just an FYI, Shoehi’s cutter isn’t a fastball and shouldn’t be grouped with fastballs. 

It profiles closer to a slider than a fastball. https://t.co/NfmbSXS02W",1514789451767054336,JMaschino_56,356386092
"Minnesota Twins Starting Rotation, Stuff+ and Pitching+

- Best Stuff+ (min. 10): Chris Archer's 4-Seam (118) 
- Best Pitching+ (min. 10): Dylan Bundy's 4-Seam (141)

"I'm gonna be completely honest.

If Paddack doesn't learn a slider, quick, I don't think he will ever be a major league starting pitcher.",1514298403764813827,JMaschino_56,356386092
"For those wondering, this is satire.

You better not have Loud and Heavy as your pitching song unless you’re fully prepared to strike out the side in the first inning. https://t.co/iMTXNqFrEu",1514292831426330626,JMaschino_56,356386092
