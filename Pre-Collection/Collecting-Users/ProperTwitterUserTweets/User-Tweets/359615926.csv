"As hard as I try, I canâ€™t get away from batshit crazy stuff like this. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ https://t.co/W6nSzzBGwR",1514283046505115649,GridironMode,359615926
"One of the things Manny Diaz did right, was recruit the quarterback position. This is the most talented and deep QB group #CanesFootball has had in a long time. He deserves credit for that. https://t.co/OkN6swYkkr",1514067013731115008,GridironMode,359615926
"If the Lakers want to right the ship, I would do the opposite of what LeBron wants to do. Be a player, we will build the team. https://t.co/aMcmtGwRE4",1513939500531007489,GridironMode,359615926
"I applaud Teddy for not taking the easy bet, which is that Tua will have a statistical improvement. Herbert however, is the much better player. https://t.co/5QHRbtpXaA",1513938955208593409,GridironMode,359615926
"#MiamiDolphins fans still bent out of shape because some of us donâ€™t see greatness in #Tua . Accept that there are those with different opinions than yours, &amp; thatâ€™s ok. Nothing would give me more pleasure than Tua becoming a great player. I just donâ€™t see that from him.",1513935971095486466,GridironMode,359615926
"#MiamiHeat fans still with that Herro starting debate. Itâ€™s not a debate, stop having it. Herro has earned the starting spot, I understand thatâ€™s not going to happen this season. But the #Heat needs to figure it out before next season. You guys think that doesnâ€™t matter to him? https://t.co/CwPnaNK3O7",1513353255564181506,GridironMode,359615926
"#Hurricane fans ask me why I havenâ€™t shown more excitement for Mario being the new HC. I point to things like this with Gino, and LarraÃ±aga. The first bump in the road, and fans jump ship real quick. Coaches need time, patience, players, administrative support, &amp; fan support. https://t.co/d4AAOWGG11",1513233314068324352,GridironMode,359615926
"Mario has supercharged the #Hurricane fan base, which is great to see. Looking forward to the start of the season, thatâ€™s when the rubber hits the road. https://t.co/IRdO2pDtlH",1513222028244840450,GridironMode,359615926
Holly Morales! What a fantastic defensive play. #LetsGoCanes @CanesBaseball,1513220474875965444,GridironMode,359615926
