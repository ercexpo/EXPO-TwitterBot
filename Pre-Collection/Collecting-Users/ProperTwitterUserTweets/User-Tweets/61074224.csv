Im gonna go out on a limb and say walking the bases loaded in the first inning is never a good thing.,1514737595221114885,ScottsOnAir,61074224
"MLB Play of the Day. Pirates -130. Adon may not be big league ready. He had control problems in the minors &amp; it showed in his 4 walks vs the Mets last start. Brubaker pitched much better at home last season. Pitt comes in with confident bats, Hayes off a 4-4 game. I like -1.5 too",1514658964201349124,ScottsOnAir,61074224
"I can’t believe Roberts pulled Kershaw. It’s not a no-hitter, it’s a Perfect Game. You let him chase that",1514322192057593857,ScottsOnAir,61074224
That’s a winner. Kershaw no hits allowed through 5 while Dodgers put up 3 early. Play of the Day improves to 6-1. https://t.co/pKHiC5yP1P,1514312159701831682,ScottsOnAir,61074224
"Dodgers start the game just like they ended last night, by loading the bases. Unfortunately, they leave em loaded but they do score 2.",1514294509240467456,ScottsOnAir,61074224
MLB Play of the Day. Dodgers F5 -.5 -115. Kershaw season debut vs Paddack making Twins debut. LA may have found their offense late last night putting some good at bats together scoring 6 in the 8th &amp; loading the bases in 8th &amp; 9th. Should carry that confidence over to today.,1514276255822016513,ScottsOnAir,61074224
Thaaaaaaaas Yankees Win. Cortes + Yankee pen pitches a shutout. Play of the Day record is 5-1. See ya tomorrow. https://t.co/GpJpNqwvMh,1514064750090489859,ScottsOnAir,61074224
Mets / Phillies F5 under was so free,1514038483626516484,ScottsOnAir,61074224
