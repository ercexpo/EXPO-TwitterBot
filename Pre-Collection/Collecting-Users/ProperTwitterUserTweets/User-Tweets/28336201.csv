Something good from tonight's Blue Jays game. Kevin Gausman generated 21 swings and misses - that is the second most by a pitcher in a game this year. 2nd behind Carlos Rodon's 24 whiffs on 4/9.,1514817293238243337,JimRileyLive,28336201
"More ðŸ¤® from The Jays/Yanks for Jays fans...

There were 17 balls hit into play with an xBA over .400 - only 5 came off a Blue Jay bat and 2 of them resulted in outs.",1514815691337084936,JimRileyLive,28336201
"If this 4 game series tells us anything, this Blue Jays/Yankees season long series is going to be ridiculous!",1514812669475184654,JimRileyLive,28336201
