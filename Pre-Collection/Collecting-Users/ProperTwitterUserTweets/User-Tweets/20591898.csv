"Like I said ahead of time, tough game for the #LAKings...

2nd game in two nights against the strong #Avs, a team that had 3 days of rest.

What a beating they are getting tonight. https://t.co/W7QqDnaU02",1514450292074500098,fredette,20591898
"#NHL 

Alexis Lafrenière scratched the #NYR 

That should be interesting.",1514423341544886282,fredette,20591898
"We're on pace to have four 50 goal scorers

√ Auston Matthews 58 
√ Leon Draisaitl        51
√ Chris Kreider         50
    Alex Ovechkin      46

And may those guys if they push hard

    Kyle Connor          42
    Connor McDavid  42
    Kirill Kaprizov        42

"6 goals &amp; 9 points, +5 for Jack Eichel in his last 8 games

Sounds like he has fully recovered but maybe a little too late though.

"4 points in 11 games for Max Domi with the #Canes 

He essentially replaced Jesperi Kotkaniemi with a 29ish point season.
😉

Maybe the #FlaPanthers knew what they were doing when the sponsored 50% of Domi's salary in the trade.

"Rule of thumb, 98 points get you in the playoffs, less than that, no so sure.

"Important and tough game for the #LAKings tonight if they want to protect their playoff spot.

It's against the #Avs, and it's a second game in two nights for the #GoKingsGo.

Meanwhile the #GoAvsGo had 3 days of rest.

We will see!",1514291153440493578,fredette,20591898
