Aye I like Donaldson but he needs to not be batting lead off bro lol.,1514787898331045891,BeeSupreme_,122786602
I did (still believe that) but that has nothing to do with simple fact that this is the Yankees first time seeing Gausman. https://t.co/aTb1Miv8rP,1514787755808616458,BeeSupreme_,122786602
Need the Yankees to score more runs though lol.,1514787372151410696,BeeSupreme_,122786602
I kinda expected the Yankees offense to struggle against Gausman because we never seen him before but I definitely think we are gonna hit him next time we play him.,1514786918642323468,BeeSupreme_,122786602
That was a grown ass man pitching performance by Luis Severino today.,1514785745004740619,BeeSupreme_,122786602
