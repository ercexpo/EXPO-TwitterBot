Colts fans are focused on the wrong pass catcher from Ohio State. https://t.co/OYqOY7hSsa,1514392999505141768,NFLscheme,353817220
"Vontae Davis retired at halftime and then went back to Utah to play safety.

Interesting career move. https://t.co/SqP6g5TTlw",1513904272672448512,NFLscheme,353817220

"If you've ever wondered why I'm not a fan of PFF's grading, here's another example of why. https://t.co/d2CzgGlJST",1512942523576209416,NFLscheme,353817220
"Every year I think to myself ""Maybe I'll get into baseball this year.""

There are people who unironically believe that Ballard became a GM thinking this way. https://t.co/uw5jPw4jRG",1512454236533141511,NFLscheme,353817220
