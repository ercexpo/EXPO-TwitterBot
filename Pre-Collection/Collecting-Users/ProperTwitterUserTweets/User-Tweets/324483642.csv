#WWERaw what a flat ending to an awfully flat show. It was on a silver platter to be on of the biggest Raw Nights following #WrestleMania38 and they dropped they ball.,1511177575716073479,liveyourpeace,324483642
#WWERaw this Edge and Priest Angle feels like this is how it should have been with Rollins and the messiah gimmick. I love this pairing!,1511168040116928517,liveyourpeace,324483642
The #Rays Trading Austin Meadows to the Tigers kills all the momentum heading into the season. And we didn't even get Top prospects for a guy worthy of it. Instead we got a guy that was going to be released by Detroit. https://t.co/r49pR0ne9r,1511164113568911361,liveyourpeace,324483642
"#WWERaw it doesn't make sense at all that there is an NXT championship match on raw. They could have used this time to build a fued between Bianca and Bailey or Auska, or Bliss. This raw is flat I hope it gets better.",1511150716961832969,liveyourpeace,324483642

"I would love to see Baker come to Tampa for this season as a backup, learn from Tom Brady and take over as the starter for the #Buccaneers in 2023  season. But if not Tampa, then I would like to see him in with the Steelers",1506353096758337545,liveyourpeace,324483642
"It's all fun and games til a hotel survey is created for the guest that goes straight to their company, who pays for the room and creates these diamond and platinum members. To see how their employee acts while on business dime. Which will effect the expense report.",1506275970281611272,liveyourpeace,324483642
