Perhaps because that decrease is happening while the OPD loses dozens of officers per month, Armstrong followed up with what appear to be specious claims about judges letting violent offenders out of jail. https://t.co/KR3rX4CnTO",1514809104534945799,hyphy_republic,167792994
"Armstrong also noted that after four trainees washed out of the academy on test fails, the current academy graduation estimate is 26. That will barely get OPD over the Measure Z requirement from current staffing--that's without counting more attrition &amp; possible loss of trainees. https://t.co/beyozi87RK",1514807038471118851,hyphy_republic,167792994
"For those keeping track, even the Oakland Police Chief now has to admit there's a decline in crime.

"Sitting in @ Police Commission meeting. As I reported this week, they will appoint alt commissioner to replace resigning Commissioner Henry Gage. Commissioner Jordan has arrived. I deleted the previous tweet to avoid misleading.",1514765354207129631,hyphy_republic,167792994
"This particular lie is made possible by David Debolt @oaklandside. @daviddebolt I've been told you value accuracy; have you corrected your assertion about the CCJPA being a train company, not a joint powers authority created by state of Ca law and run by public transit agencies? https://t.co/AjCQU4k9B7",1514750678316453888,hyphy_republic,167792994

I really feel like city/opd are scurrying to put controlled narratives so media won't focus on self-inflicted wound caused by officers leaving en masse for personal benefit--to avoid the jab and get a signing bonus at another jurisdiction. 30 officers have left in past two months https://t.co/K3DLXLXZB9,1514740660854685712,hyphy_republic,167792994
