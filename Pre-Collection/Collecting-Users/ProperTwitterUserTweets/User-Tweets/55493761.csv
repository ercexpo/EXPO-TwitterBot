"The most fun I’ve had on a podcast in a long time. 

Major thanks to @RyanWardLA for joining us on the @EthosLakers show. 

A lot of awesome insight into the behind the scenes of this Lakers team. https://t.co/W46toUzERQ",1514626477861457924,Ethan_Norof,55493761
I'm available for consult for 1% of the contract option. https://t.co/5cWKcrXQfm,1514418189693718529,Ethan_Norof,55493761
"0.00010455% of all games in MLB history have been perfect games. 

Clayton Kershaw had everything aligned through seven innings—on 80 pitches—and the Dodgers said, “nah, we good.”

What a lesson in failing to value the moment.",1514333798103584769,Ethan_Norof,55493761
"I often wish homelessness could be framed as an issue to be solved for those without homes instead of an issue for those in permanent housing who have to “deal with it.”

To see “politicians” running on platforms to “clean the streets” rather than to help people in need…nah.",1514274811932934145,Ethan_Norof,55493761
"Update: Heard directly from leadership with a firm and action-oriented response. I am appreciative of the quick attention to this and a sincere desire to do better, but also want to recognize the impact of this experience. https://t.co/cA0RZJJKGU",1514050693623025664,Ethan_Norof,55493761
Quite an interesting @Nordstrom experience today where all the white women around were asked if they needed help but my non-white girlfriend didn’t get offered assistance once.,1513990788132134914,Ethan_Norof,55493761
Should be 5-0. #lgm,1513697418667122693,Ethan_Norof,55493761
Luis Guillorme becoming a regular presence within the Mets might be my favorite development amidst it all.,1513679111775932417,Ethan_Norof,55493761
"Lakers somehow come out looking worse in their attempts to explain the season than when they were all silent. 

That’s incredible for all of the wrong reasons.",1513657086911004672,Ethan_Norof,55493761
Mets with 25 hits in the first two games of the season—both wins—is a VERY nice development.,1512639491902607364,Ethan_Norof,55493761
