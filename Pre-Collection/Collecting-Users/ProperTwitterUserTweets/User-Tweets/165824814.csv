"Command/control is the least of my worries with Nick Lodolo.

Average exit velocity on the 15 balls in play against Lodolo yesterday: 81.4 mph. That breaking ball is going to cause a tremendous amount of problems for hitters. #Reds",1514571827103870980,RedsFan_Brandon,165824814
Austin Hendrickâ€™s first hit of the season is a 413 foot double off the bat at 106.6 mph. Hopefully that jumpstarts him. #Reds,1514405427634741253,RedsFan_Brandon,165824814
"Matt McLain showcasing some opposite field power with a HR to right field. Heâ€™s homered in consecutive games to push his early season OPS over 1.000. #Reds

Itâ€™s only one rehab start but I will never understand this trade from the #Reds perspective. Never. https://t.co/2QpvPUybWP,1514389116166750209,RedsFan_Brandon,165824814
One more Mike Siani stat: heâ€™s seen 58 pitches this season and has only swung and missed once. #Reds https://t.co/kJpQG7RmW7,1514368909952040969,RedsFan_Brandon,165824814
"Lodolo averaged 94.1 mph today on his FB/sinker. That places him right there in LHSP velocity with Max Fried (93.9) and Julio UrÃ­as (94.1).

His 2727 rpm on his CB wouldâ€™ve ranked 7th among all LHP with a minimum 500 pitches thrown.

Kid has great stuff. Canâ€™t wait for start #2. https://t.co/CyDIlEinll",1514364573012353031,RedsFan_Brandon,165824814
