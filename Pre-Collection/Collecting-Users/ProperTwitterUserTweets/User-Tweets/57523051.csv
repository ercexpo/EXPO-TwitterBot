"Amed reminds me a lot of Elvis Andrus. He‚Äôs got a little more juice but Andrus got on base more. Long term Starter level but not an All Star.

There‚Äôs a team out there that would love that. It‚Äôs not Cleveland because of who they have in house.

I think it‚Äôs the Angels. We‚Äôll see.",1514652120808632324,JakerBrahney,57523051

"A little more chasing today. Maybe a product of feelin ourselves a bit over the past 4 games.

Not complaining- but something noticeable",1514320319674265605,JakerBrahney,57523051
"Feel like Franmil is a walking 3 pitch K right now. Would you slide him down in the lineup? Especially with some hot bats right behind him?

I think it‚Äôs worth talking about.",1514294829546627076,JakerBrahney,57523051
