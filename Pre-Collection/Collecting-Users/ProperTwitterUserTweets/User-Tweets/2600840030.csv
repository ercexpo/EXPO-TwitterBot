"We all have our favorite prospects &amp; are passionate about who we'd prefer, but regardless of who the Jets pick, this team will be better in 2022. This will be a historic draft class; 4 picks in the top 50 &amp; nine picks overall have me feeling good about the future #TakeFlight https://t.co/v5R85Hh824",1514651723972984834,JoeJet_5,2600840030

"There are a lot of DE getting love in the first round, but Hall is the prototypical strong side edge in a Saleh defenseâ€”very much in the same mold of an Arik Armstead. 

Heâ€™s one of my favorite late first/round 2 prospects and the perfect fit opposite Carl Lawson #TakeFlight https://t.co/KUQlrOCeYb",1513655059976015876,JoeJet_5,2600840030

"I like this trade for the #Jets. Saints could potentially be looking to acquire ammunition to move up for a QB or a cornerstone LT (Ekwonu, Neal, Cross) to replace Armstead. Picks 4 or 10 both become intriguing spots for a trade back #takeflight https://t.co/go91zZRqN0",1511078472575340549,JoeJet_5,2600840030
