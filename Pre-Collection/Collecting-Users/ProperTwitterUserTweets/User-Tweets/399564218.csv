"Kevin Gausman's record shows that after 9 previous MLB seasons, his only winning season was last year with SFG. His overall W-L record is 64-72 and his ERA is 4.03.  He was with Baltimore for many years, so maybe he can win with a winning team. #BlueJays #MLBTheShow22",1514791369159573512,bobcatbobby88,399564218
Dylan Samberg is having a great game tonight for the #NHLJets,1513683981644058628,bobcatbobby88,399564218
The #BlueJays shouldn't push this #NextLevel hype too much because if they begin to lose too many games there is a good chance these expectations will be their nemesis. They have to reach this level consistently in April for it to be credible. Hopefully they can.,1513242280731287576,bobcatbobby88,399564218
Ryu may not last too long as a starter this year. #BlueJays,1513228683137458182,bobcatbobby88,399564218
"No, the #NHLJets have won five games after the first round since 2011, not four. They beat Vegas in game 1 of the conference finals after defeating Nashville in 2018.

"Globe sports writer Cathal Kelly #GlobeAndMail says in today's column, a couple months after arriving back home in Canada, that he ""hasn't travelled much since 2020"", apparently forgetting that he was recently in China to cover the Olympics. That's called travelling, #CathalKelly",1512808792458768390,bobcatbobby88,399564218

Pretty hard to destroy a dead team. #NHLJets https://t.co/CLe1N24emX,1511891575634280453,bobcatbobby88,399564218
Why are people saying that the #BlueJays #Jays are going to win the AL East? I know they're good but they are making it sound automatic. It sets up high expectations and puts pressure on them.,1511891232615714819,bobcatbobby88,399564218
