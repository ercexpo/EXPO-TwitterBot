The Yankees will regret the way they handled this year's exceptional class of free agent shortstops for years to come. #Yankees https://t.co/bOlV0ITjgT,1505568411765645313,TripsTake,59653454
This trade is looking better and better. #Yankees https://t.co/GK5sWpD6s3,1505345602896470017,TripsTake,59653454
"Awful job by the Yankees. For three years, $105 million, they could have made the commitment had they not made the Josh Donaldson trade, which enabled the Twins to make the move themselves. https://t.co/MyYzYh8Y3h",1505187116682133510,TripsTake,59653454
One positive of acquiring Josh Donaldson and Kiner-Falefa is that it should allow the Yankees to include Gleyber Torres and/or Luke Voit in a Matt Olson deal. #Yankees https://t.co/OBkHTBiFsY,1503372192909778944,TripsTake,59653454
"Unless Ben Rortvedt becomes a quality starting catcher, it's difficult to like this deal for the Yankees. The players they're giving up aren't the problem: it's allocating $50 million to an injury prone 36-year-old 3B and signaling they won't spend on an elite shortstop. #Yankees",1503359197957824516,TripsTake,59653454
"It's a waste to sign Joe Buck to a five-year, $75 million contract and make him NFL exclusive. I'm relatively surprised Buck would agree to give up national baseball telecasts despite this staggering sum. https://t.co/hCXUpujjzP",1502631898341953536,TripsTake,59653454

"I love this unit for the Knicks and it's already paying dividends on the court: McBride, Quickley, Barrett, Reddish and Sims should see a good chunk of time together down the stretch of this game and the remainder of the season. #Knicks",1500700694055202823,TripsTake,59653454
"At some point, anyone who supports this man needs to look in the mirror and ask themselves why. When did he ever sacrifice for the betterment of the country? Does he care about anything but himself? We all know the answers. https://t.co/armbM0R4Be",1496780982464090121,TripsTake,59653454
