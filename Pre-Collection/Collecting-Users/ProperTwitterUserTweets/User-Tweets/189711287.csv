Absolutely raking with Taylor Walls on The Show this year. I also lost this game on a Jose Abreu walk off home run in the ninth lol https://t.co/iFuu7CmsNd,1514687508247949317,__Murphy88,189711287
New Video: A bit of a sneak peak. Here’s the first inning of Jared Jones’ first start of the season against Greensboro. Rest of the will drop with the article https://t.co/WqqVxqAF4q #LetsGoBucs,1514684329623965701,__Murphy88,189711287
"This is a small but subtle thing that I love seeing from young pitchers, especially ones with an arm like Jones. The ability to lead with the breaking ball and using the fastball off of it. Not relying on the fastball all the time, even when its that good. #LetsGoBucs https://t.co/doQyUyOmqt",1514656140155666435,__Murphy88,189711287
Hey follow my guy @Murphanko or else he might come to your house and steal all your snacks. Also you'll learn a lot about the Pirates. https://t.co/ehUiWdXMBb,1514655023820587018,__Murphy88,189711287
So rewatched the Jared Jones start from Tuesday. That was one of the most electric first innings I’ve seen from a pitcher in a while. Working on a breakdown/recap now of it. #LetsGoBucs,1514652653183250434,__Murphy88,189711287

Why did it take a day to get Josh VanMeter onto the Pirates on #MLBTheshow but now we are a week into the season without a roster update we can use? Did they just give up once the season started?,1514625048484720641,__Murphy88,189711287
