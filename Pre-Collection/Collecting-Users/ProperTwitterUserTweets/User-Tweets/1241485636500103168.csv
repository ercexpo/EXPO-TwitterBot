Also Trae 8/24 3 turnovers 1/7 from 3. His team absolutely carried him in the beginning of the game each starter was out performing him. He finally made some shots after just chucking the rock at the hoop and earned some free throws. I donâ€™t see the superstar yâ€™all referring to. https://t.co/wmAJV7q76t,1514415820679565318,M9rcusN,1241485636500103168
