LOTS of #DodgerBlue on this ‘65 @Topps league leader showing NL’s best two ERAs. 😍 #AGoodMailDay #Dodgers #HOFers https://t.co/uXeUFdjvZj,1513956248957378567,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
"Just ❤️ this ‘77 #Topps card:
Day game, great action shot of #Royals icon in powder blue pullover, sans batting glove &amp; great stirrups. @GeorgeHBrett had hits in droves in ‘76, leading MLB w/ 215 &amp; also w/ 14 triples (2nd yr in a row); AL best BA (.333) &amp; most TBs (298).🔥 https://t.co/qYphXhhauu",1513162227947347971,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
"Not all #beaters are equal. Got this ‘57 #Whitey for $4.50…it’s got major edge &amp; corner wear but pic is clean, no holes, nothing I have a problem w/ given the price tag! And check out Edward’s winning % after 5 yrs: .741!😳🔥 #Yankees #collect https://t.co/q3CmduiqOJ",1512917046534844418,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
My plan was to give away whichever card’s tweet got more likes…so I’m keeping the ‘52 Mays &amp; will lose the ‘78 Biff to the 1000th like! 😉😜 https://t.co/cuULlZ4FmW,1512792387260669953,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
"I use Twitter to teach my sons about marketing, sales, “connecting”. This week I tweeted a role player’s $.25 card w/ simple but nostalgic message. The uni, name &amp; era hold LOTS of memories: ~900❤️s for Biff! Then a 🐐’s $1000+ card w/ factoid: 6❤️s. #Emotion #Connect #Concise 😀 https://t.co/2LgkyRoCiQ",1512791978190295043,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
I’m a Buck Showalter fan. Liked him w/ #Yankees pre-Torre. Seeing Buck now w/ #Mets made me think of this ‘63 #Topps card. 1st Mgr ever to pilot both #Yankees &amp; #Mets AND the 1st player ever to play for both clubs. https://t.co/zamjIIVpbN,1512549488430391297,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
"A good bar bet for you:
Name the player w/ most #OpeningDay starts at 1B.

If you came up w/ this 5’8” 155 lbs #Senators vet who made 19 OD starts (1916-34), you are a ⚾️ savant! Judge is 3 starts ahead of ⭐️s Helton, McGriff, Hernandez &amp; Eddie Murray…each a more likely guess. https://t.co/4fHkKgNIPF",1512455865906958343,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
"This #HOF icon made a record 16 #OpeningDay starts in his career, 2 more than any other hurler in MLB history. #TomTerrific made 10-straight OD starts for #Mets (‘68-77) then added 6 more over next 9 yrs w/ #Reds, #Mets &amp; #WhiteSox. https://t.co/8KThCQH7pm",1512041866946134020,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
"Besides Mays’ record 21 in CF, three other players have made 20 #OpeningDay starts at same position, each being the most at their position: Pudge at C, Morgan at 2B &amp; Brooks at 3B. No surprise, all 4 are HOFers &amp; all 4 are argued among the best ever at their position. https://t.co/6mkZIsa3sN",1511844106124906500,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
"An #OpeningDay factoid for you!
This #Giants icon has most ever Opening Day starts at 1 position w/ 21 in CF. The #SayHeyKid’s 1st OD start was in ‘52 at age 20. He’d miss ‘53 OD due to military service🇺🇸 but run out 20 straight from ‘54 to his final in ‘73 w/ #Mets.🐐 https://t.co/kj2za3VesM",1511705842839605254,CardboardHistry,873879925807353856
