"Should refine my earlier “60% chance Elon wins out” take: think there’s 60%+ odds that *A* deal happens, whether it’s Elon’s or something triggered by Elon’s actions, albeit to another buyer. Twitter has a vaguely better roadmap than under Dorsey but still no ability to execute. https://t.co/e3Ppw2OuFu",1514616636296208398,caseyayers,6419632
Good point. I’m skeptical that any large tech firm or entertainment name wants the headache – think they would mostly bail like Disney did – but it’s an incredible opportunity for a Middle-Eastern sovereign wealth fund to purchase themselves Bytedance-style influence overnight. https://t.co/uuzdtoael6,1514614041641033737,caseyayers,6419632

"Great question! Apparently? But there’s been no announcement, because why would there be two weeks away from the few precious minutes in time that can somewhat justify the agony of last season? https://t.co/SnQaxTZXZA",1514611978794274829,caseyayers,6419632
Honestly going to be upset at this point if Willem Dafoe doesn’t host the draft party. https://t.co/JWi7wPv3bT,1514607412761677841,caseyayers,6419632
"Don’t mistake the Twitter offer for a profit play. Musk is simply willing to pay what it takes to never log off, and lacks the social faculties to learn the rules of moderation from the experience of others. The bid is strong; Twitter has few places to turn for alternatives.",1514583694534664200,caseyayers,6419632
