"The same way Jag fans and the Front Office are on totally different pages concerning Cam Robinson, I think we are going to learn that the same applies to the WR room as well this draft...I don't expect WR at 33 and wouldn't be surprised if they wait till 106. #Jaguars #NFLDraft",1514328445488091137,MT_Baird,188357784
"We are 20 days out from the NFL Draft, and the leading WR in the NCAA will not be drafted…mark my words, won’t be drafted.",1512590487336673290,MT_Baird,188357784
This is why the Jaguars should be selecting Evan Neal at 1. https://t.co/zjQie284Lo,1510996852715528199,MT_Baird,188357784
Very excited about this! https://t.co/ylA0LnfdvW,1509974982981525505,MT_Baird,188357784
Hey @England remember us! #USMNT https://t.co/gjcHe0BU7B,1509967535374016522,MT_Baird,188357784
I believe that GB and the USMNT needs to bring in as much of the WC Squad as they can in the June window for Nations League...a lot of these guys were injured during qualifying and didnt get to play with each other consistently. Use those four games to work on chemistry. #usmnt,1509551172893523971,MT_Baird,188357784
I hope Matt Turner wins the Arsenal job and get Zack Steffens out of goal. He continually makes mistakes bc he never plays in games.,1509359114509561861,MT_Baird,188357784
GB goin’ for the W!! Love it! https://t.co/FBe0EbFNor,1509320485254967298,MT_Baird,188357784
"This guy is going to be a draft day steal, especially if he goes day 3. https://t.co/k7SH6Bymrp",1509186878771286016,MT_Baird,188357784
"As of this morning, Jags had holes at EDGE and LG. Most of us thought Hutchinson at 1 would fix the EDGE and a later pick and current players would compete for LG...Now with the signing of Key, I honestly dont know where the Jags will go at 1. If it is me, NEAL! #Jaguars",1509185809060147204,MT_Baird,188357784
