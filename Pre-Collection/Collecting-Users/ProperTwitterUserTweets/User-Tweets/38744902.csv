"#WillAndChris #WillSmith #willsmithchrisrock #Oscars2022 I don't get the fury over Will Smith's slap. I get it, Chris Rock's job involves making jokes, but maybe have sense not to joke about a man's wife's medical condition, especially in their presence? https://t.co/iZ6xXv40Ul",1508868443763884040,MrAsISeeEm,38744902
This situation is disgusting. @bakermayfield is a tough competitor who made Cleveland relevant. He toughed it out injured and this is his thanks. @Browns were a joke without him. The @Panthers are morons if they don't gun for him. #BakerMayfield https://t.co/K52NqGgXrH,1506368938363473924,MrAsISeeEm,38744902
"What did @CalvinRidley1 do that was so awful? He wasn't even with the team then, probably bored silly, so he bet on his fave team. It's @NFL bullcrap like this that likely drove him to need a mental health break at all. A-hole league. #CalvinRidley  https://t.co/ieiyUFANuP",1501038099522015240,MrAsISeeEm,38744902
"#samdarnold #draftbusts Sad that Sam Darnold appears to be among biggest draft busts ever. Yes, @nyjets didn't properly support him, it wasn't all his fault, but what it is, what it is. Lesson nobody ever seems to learn, never draft a USC quarterback.  https://t.co/hbdDFAoreC",1493299742259961862,MrAsISeeEm,38744902
"#UkraineInvasion #Ukraine #RussiaUkraineCrisis #VladimirPutin #NATO At this point, I say throw Russia a bone &amp; keep Ukraine out of NATO. Ukraine can live with being in Russian orbit if Russia agrees otherwise to leave it be. NATO inclusion's not worth WW3. https://t.co/5gpxQbQG5u",1493298149837975553,MrAsISeeEm,38744902
"#SuperBowl #MattStafford #LVI #AaronDonald So happy for @RamsNFL , Aaron Donald and especially Matt Stafford, who so deserved this after so many miserable years in Detroit. What a great winning drive.",1493063916494147587,MrAsISeeEm,38744902
"Hey, can we hold the ""talks"" with Russia over the Ukraine in Munich? You know, for old time sake? Invite China to play Mussolini.
