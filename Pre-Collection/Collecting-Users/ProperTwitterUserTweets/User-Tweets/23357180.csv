"In fairness to the #Packers, that's not what they're doing. 

What they're doing here is going from MVS to Watkins which is an absolute upgrade. 

It's yet to be seen who will replace Adams as their No. 1 WR. https://t.co/fZLbSo8Xft",1514679919816679436,TomKessenich,23357180
"Watkins is currently WR140 in @thenffc this month. 

No seriously. He's WR140 with an ADP of 317. That's actually hilarious. 

Yes his ADP will rise now. #Packers",1514678420260667392,TomKessenich,23357180
"Not the veteran WR I would've signed but he'll be OK until the inevitable injury strikes.

And he will get injured.

Sam Watkins always gets injured. https://t.co/pWIkAcQmtT",1514677779098386447,TomKessenich,23357180
He's the anti-Aaron Rodgers https://t.co/NqMDJwobYL,1514637571766243331,TomKessenich,23357180
"He's not my top choice for a vet WR (Landry is by far) but he'd be OK. I get the appeal and I think he'd do all right. Durability is a major concern, though. https://t.co/4rcdkT6cUU",1514636256109645825,TomKessenich,23357180
Scary to think what a gigantic upgrade Sam Watkins represents to the #Packers WR corps at the present time. https://t.co/DJDe1QoidP,1514633485679480835,TomKessenich,23357180
Forgot about Terry McLaurin in this earlier Tweet. Huge oversight. If the #Packers could lure him away from the #Commanders that would be a fantastic move. He'd be my No. 2 option behind D.K. https://t.co/ihb9F2Nm8F,1514627919360016391,TomKessenich,23357180
Metcalf or McLaurin to the #Packers and drinks are on me. https://t.co/tXBJAzRKyE,1514627362943606787,TomKessenich,23357180
"Yelich isn't chasing but he has 0 HRs and only 2 RBIs. 

So what exactly is he doing well? 

.423 OBP is great but he's supposed to be a run producer. https://t.co/wM0Qca9DMP",1514625754662944771,TomKessenich,23357180
"His ADP has only risen slightly in @TheNFFC since he signed with the #Rams. He's WR35 this month. Still a MASSIVE value pick with an ADP of 82.83. Bob Trees was going in the third a year ago and as much as I love Bobby Trees, ARob's better. https://t.co/KSzeQ4G2ul",1514618639181307904,TomKessenich,23357180
