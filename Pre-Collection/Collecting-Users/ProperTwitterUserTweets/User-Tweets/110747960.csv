"#unpopularopinion Real enemies to lovers in contemporary romance would get an author cancelled, that's why. There's no way to display this trope in the way ppl ask for without folks throwing a fit about it being problematic. https://t.co/caOFBT23tR",1514834483836428291,chanelhardypub_,110747960

That running joke that women don't understand superhero movies is so corny. Idk why men act like the comic/nerd fandom belongs to them. Not to mention those Marvel movies are way too popular for y'all to act like it's some niche community lmao.,1514822892608843779,chanelhardypub_,110747960
"Who hasn't seen an MCU movie at this point? There's not much to explain. You can pretty much follow all the films even if u haven't seen the previous ones. That's pretty much been Marvel's appeal. Now the shows, that's a different story. https://t.co/dtSiCF6K9q",1514821444521189379,chanelhardypub_,110747960
Not y'all playing inspector gadget over rich celebrities relationships lol.  And y'all do realize that a couple can be broken up and still be seen in public together when they have a kid/about to have a kid together? https://t.co/qMhao71dFc,1514819582665535491,chanelhardypub_,110747960
"People trying to paint this woman as homophobic and no we aren't about to do that. The first line is a bit transphobic, but otherwise her feelings are legitimate here. And it sounds like she just wants him to be honest and not DL. Which is again, legitimate. https://t.co/dbdeNuqwnj",1514782304106803203,chanelhardypub_,110747960
"I've been going down the rabbit hole of vintage pulp fiction and I'm so intrigued! Anyone know where to buy vintage out-of-print paperbacks? Also, this cover art style &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything else publishing is crapping out these days. https://t.co/msg4QaHugu",1514684450201747460,chanelhardypub_,110747960
Short stories always get me out of my reading slumps. I've been binge reading all of Renee Miller's novellas in-between reading the Sookie Stackhouse series. I'll probably only read the first two tho. https://t.co/Wr3e3suYVv,1514625794567380994,chanelhardypub_,110747960
"When I worked at Starbucks at the harbor years ago, we used to bring the patio furniture in after closing and that shit felt like slave labor. The things I did for shit pay back then? Never again. Jobs get the bare minimum outta me now. https://t.co/41yZRcHdAH",1514621441760583681,chanelhardypub_,110747960
"If I ever owned anything it would be a condo. I need the benefits of homeowning with the luxuries of apartment living. When my friend had to spend her vacation fund to fix an emergency repair, I knew home owning wasn't for me LMAO. I need maintenance on speed dial.",1514618071922610177,chanelhardypub_,110747960
