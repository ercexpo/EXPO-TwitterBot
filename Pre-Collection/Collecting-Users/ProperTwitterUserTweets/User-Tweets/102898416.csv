It’s funny to me that some Packers fans are like “they need to upgrade over guys like Lazard and MVS!” but then they stump for the team to draft their doppelgängers (London and Watson) 🤣,1514781999273181190,itsjustChrisnow,102898416
"Unrelated but isn’t it weird how Matthews was such a great player for so many years and yet he’s basically vanished from our collective memory about the team? Like, we remember some guys from that era fondly and some not. But Clay…we don’t seem to remember in any sense. https://t.co/69WeLZbl32",1514767323214667784,itsjustChrisnow,102898416
This had me…right until the “they have disclosed this to Williams” part. Zero chance they’d tip their hand like to the player. They’ve literally never done that since Ted took over. https://t.co/MB4IBILSYf,1514753895934963721,itsjustChrisnow,102898416
It’s basically like signing a faster Funchess. That’s what this is. It’s fine. It just doesn’t change anything for the draft. I don’t hate it or love it really.,1514678010426888198,itsjustChrisnow,102898416
My fear is Rodgers - who’s never been huge on throwing to rookies - will use a guy like Watkins as a crutch which would hinder the young guys development. https://t.co/AlHTsqOJ7L,1514637199794442251,itsjustChrisnow,102898416
The hype on Watkins has never ever matched the output. Still need to draft two receivers high even if they sign him. I guess he’d add depth but whatever.,1514634507441393676,itsjustChrisnow,102898416

Totally agree. Could easily see GB trade out of 28 and dip back to the early part of round two. Send 28 to Cleveland for 44 and 78? That’s 660 points each way according to the Jimmy Johnson chart. https://t.co/6WS7gODocX,1514625879233765383,itsjustChrisnow,102898416
Hell yeah brother! Some of the lights have broken off but I still have mine. Right on top of my piece of Lambeau turf from the ‘97 playoffs and next to my Favre bobblehead that looks nothing like Favre 🤣 https://t.co/89k2JBERjF https://t.co/2eJN7W4fOZ,1514433382809321479,itsjustChrisnow,102898416
