"I've been walkin' the streets at night
Just tryin' to get it right
It's hard to see with so many around 
You know I don't like bein' stuck in the crowd 
An' the streets don't change, but maybe the names 
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you…",1514813205045932036,wtfbrowns,197456738
"And high up above, or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you",1514809060138258432,wtfbrowns,197456738
