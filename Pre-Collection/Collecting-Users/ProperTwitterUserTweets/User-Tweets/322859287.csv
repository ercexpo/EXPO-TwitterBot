Weird take. I can see bad at watching football or something but job or life? https://t.co/mYD1OUAGec,1514574334983118850,MikeBCSN,322859287
Barry Bonds league wide but for the Indians/Guardians Kenny Lofton. Honorable mention to Grady Sizemore. https://t.co/AKrD3xcgGK,1514573684861816834,MikeBCSN,322859287
I would've let Kershaw start the 8th but I have no problem with Roberts pulling him. Only because spring training was so short though.,1514573126390235148,MikeBCSN,322859287
Baker Mayfield may want to show up to my job to boo me but I'm pretty confident that if I stood 2 ft to his right he wouldn't even see me.,1514375612034654213,MikeBCSN,322859287
Michael takes his mask off and it turns out he was  Adam Sandler all along who was driven mad by watching Little Nicky on repeat for 6 months https://t.co/vNOHX42GvN,1514341508895449095,MikeBCSN,322859287
Will this be the Giants first ever trip to Progressive Field? I can't remember them ever coming in during interleague play.,1514339734474080266,MikeBCSN,322859287
I can't believe in all these highlight packages they show of Garrett Wilson they don't show his catch against Michigan this year where he got interfered with and still caught the ball. I mean it was about Ohio State's only highlight in that game.,1514222157928275968,MikeBCSN,322859287
Amazing note on the Giants... In the 15 yrs since Bonds retired they have had 15 different open day LFs. Doesn't seem possible.,1514062316676997123,MikeBCSN,322859287
