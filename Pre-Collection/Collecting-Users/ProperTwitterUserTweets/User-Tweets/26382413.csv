The ace of the staff and Gerrit Cole talking shop. Nice to see Nestor giving Cole some much needed tips. https://t.co/SdPZTgz5oL,1514825969789554690,jc_dickinson,26382413
Only needed to face Springer and Bichette. Hell of a job by King. https://t.co/W8WHfbzAaB,1514812469461409804,jc_dickinson,26382413

The first Aroldis Chapman sweat of the year. Did not miss this. #RepBX,1514809302749392905,jc_dickinson,26382413
