We don't hate Kyrie. We feel sorry for him https://t.co/WUlOUWHfTu,1514796646588067843,celticsforum,1357723064771903488
"Celtics lead 99-95 

Just over 2 minutes remaining.

KD looking for his shot. Dribbles right and left.

Whistle! Foul! Who is it on?

Ben Simmons was fouled on purpose away from the ball. He'll go to the free throw line and likely miss both. What a strategy by Boston, folks.",1514791502089650179,celticsforum,1357723064771903488
Theis and Al's d on Bruce Brown first time he drives the paint https://t.co/cP2YSKOZdV,1514781025422872578,celticsforum,1357723064771903488
"I haven't played in a year. I absolutely refuse to shoot the ball. I play for the Brooklyn Nets and nets fans are saying I'm the missing piece to a championship LMAO ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ 

Can you guess who I am?",1514673844035932166,celticsforum,1357723064771903488
Tatum really went head first into this series .. he wants all the smoke.. all the glory. He's the ultimate superstar... didn't duck the 2 seed like another guy,1514654196636729353,celticsforum,1357723064771903488

"Nets fans think Simmons represents their Draymond like what KD had in GS. And maybe he does BUT the dif. Is Steph and Klay stretched the court to 30ft!

Nets offense will be much more condensed (less space to guard) &amp; every time Ben gets it D will fall back, daring him to shoot.",1514605730891849737,celticsforum,1357723064771903488
If they get Ben back we're sending his ass to the line every time a game is close in the 4QTR. HAHAHAHA,1514599021934956548,celticsforum,1357723064771903488
"Nets fans finding out they get Ben Simmons back are as delusional as Lakers fans were when they found out they signed Russ. ðŸ˜‚ 

Adding a dude mid series who hasn't played in a year who can't shoot, who's done nothing but lose in the playoffs.. seems like a bad move.",1514598335532912642,celticsforum,1357723064771903488
