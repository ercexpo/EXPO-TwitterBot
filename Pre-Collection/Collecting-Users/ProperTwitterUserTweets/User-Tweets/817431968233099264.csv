Didnt realize they screwed Bouknight over that much. I was very high on him in the draft and think he can be a good quality player in the NBA. Pretty irresponsible to not keep him in the rotation in a heavy bench role at least. https://t.co/i4Efs5resj,1514708884061143040,CollinL97,817431968233099264
Finished moving to my new apartment! Now to find a new part time job and make some new connections. I start school at UK this summer. I am very excited for this next chapter in my life!,1514683577941774339,CollinL97,817431968233099264
