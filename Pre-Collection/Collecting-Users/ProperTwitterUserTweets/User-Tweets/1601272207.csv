"I swear @BallySports has the worst app and they do anything to show an ad. 

I clicked ""watch now"", they showed an ad. Ok fine. 

It kicked me back to the home screen and then they showed me the same ad again.",1513276034489139201,JD_Alsobrook,1601272207
Positive - the team didn't have any injuries during the game and they actually get time to prep knowing that their starting striker will be out. #atlutd https://t.co/7fiz5zLUkg,1513239852548079620,JD_Alsobrook,1601272207

"""it's gonna be a long 6 -8 weeks without Josef""

Is it? Is it really? Lol The team finds out they lose Josef this week and fans think the team wasn't going to need time to adjust? 

Give them a few weeks to actually practice without their number 1 striker
