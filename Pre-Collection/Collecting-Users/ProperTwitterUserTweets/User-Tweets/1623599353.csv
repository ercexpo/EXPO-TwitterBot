"Over the next two seasons, the #Chiefs need starters at:
EDGEx2

OLB
DT
WR

S

Key role players at:

OLx3
LBx2

The idea that they have ""too many picks"" is just wrong. Plenty of players on the roster right now that can be cut for younger talent. #ChiefsKingdom",1514021367582187532,citadelchief,1623599353
"#Chiefs don't show well here. We know that the low number of picks is due to trades for Mahomes and Brown, but poor value is the real bummer.

"If the #Chiefs somehow pulled this off, it would easily be a top tier draft class.  Mafe, Dotson, and Ojabo with first 3 picks is an instant W. #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/mBnh09YicJ",1513531268658565122,citadelchief,1623599353

"Great interview that shines some light into the last season. ""It's a business"" is always the line...but we sometimes forget that for guys like @Mathieu_Era it's also their lives. #Chiefs #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/JRB2HRQg6F",1512439198191656964,citadelchief,1623599353
"*IF* the #Chiefs were to trade up, this is the only acceptable target.  EDGE and WR draft classes are too strong to be moving up for someone in the 1st. #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/dxVmW5jb0H",1512222816174854150,citadelchief,1623599353
