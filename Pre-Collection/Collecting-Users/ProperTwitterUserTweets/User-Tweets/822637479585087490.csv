"Year before last I talked up Jefferson like crazy. Thought we had him. Last year I talked up Devonta like crazy. Somehow, got him. This year JW was my guy. If we could get him due to his injury I am 1000000% in. It’s a worthwhile risk imo. He’s so much better than drake or burks",1514806248805265420,brdphillyteachr,822637479585087490

The fact that Jokic is going to win the mvp over Joel disgusts me. The point of basketball is to score and to stop guys from scoring on you. Embiid does both as well as anyone in the league and yet some fat dude who makes some fancy passes beats him out for some insane reasoning,1513714651665776640,brdphillyteachr,822637479585087490
Unreal performance from the #Phillies bullpen tonight. As a unit they’ve looked outstanding so far. Please keep this up! It’s literally the difference between them being a good team or just an okay team.,1513710944395931652,brdphillyteachr,822637479585087490
My 2 year old just got into the candy basket unattended. When asked how many he had he quickly admitted he had eaten “one and three and too many.” 🤦🏻‍♂️,1513180725981466628,brdphillyteachr,822637479585087490
"Just had meatballs and ricotta from Limerick Italian Kitchen in Limerick, PA. Honestly the best meatballs I’ve ever had. And I’ve been to south Philly many times. These hit different. Said what I said. Fight me.",1512599581871255560,brdphillyteachr,822637479585087490
"So Schwarber had 2 hits, 2 rbis and a homer. Bryce doubled in a run and scored twice. Hoskins had 2 hits, 2 rbi and 2 runs. Castellanos with an RBI double. Stott with 2 hits, an rbi an a run. What is there not to be happy about?! God damn I’m pumped!!!!",1512572777420709895,brdphillyteachr,822637479585087490
