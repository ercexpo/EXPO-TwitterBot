Just did a FaceTime with @ViktorTheViking and @blue and all I’m gonna say is a certain someone was GRUMPY!  Someone’s braids are a little tight today #MascotProblems #Seahawks,1513913394063187968,hawks_fanguy,788537704132718592

New meal plan and workout regimen is working very nicely!  Easy…..and quick results thanks to “Abs by @dkm14 “ https://t.co/IWv1CHMJhw #Seahawks,1512494150788206603,hawks_fanguy,788537704132718592
I appreciate the apology @StacyRost but like @jtheaps9 said it’s about actions.  Just send that @dkm14 meal prep kit to VMAC and I think I can forget about this tweet! #Friends #Seahawks,1511422070973943819,hawks_fanguy,788537704132718592
I’m currently tuned into @SEASports710 waiting to hear @StacyRost personally apologize for this tweet! I know @jtheaps9 has my back! https://t.co/Gh60I9sEYd #Seahawks,1511406833705132045,hawks_fanguy,788537704132718592
