Really excited for this - Purkey is a genius and this looks rad as hell. https://t.co/q0p2pYDfPo,1514254508523671564,SeanTheBaptiste,14498622
"My favorite joke/hoax ever played was ""I, Libertine"" - pulled off by Jean Shepherd in the 1950s. I think about it far more than I probably should - it's a brilliant prank and there are a few great YouTube videos about it (one by Austin McConnell.)",1514247312884834304,SeanTheBaptiste,14498622

Found out Mel Brooks got a drum lesson from Buddy Rich as a kid such is basically the coolest thing ever.",1512546991573807122,SeanTheBaptiste,14498622
