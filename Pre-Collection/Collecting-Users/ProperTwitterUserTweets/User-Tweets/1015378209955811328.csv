"Kirk just needs to beat New England, KC, Indy and Cincy to join the exclusive club of beating all 32 NFL teams. What sucks is he should’ve beaten Cincy twice and was a Doctson drop TD away from being close as well. 2022 he has a chance against NE and Indy to shrink the list",1514443375684071430,Donjuliothe4th,1015378209955811328

I enjoy ur QB takes ur absolutely right. People don’t get Vikes have had the worst defensives the last 2 years and OL since Kirk been there has been bad. They have literally invested close to 100 milly on defense last 2 seasons. I think people using Kirk’s contracts is an excuse https://t.co/HgstJdPRAr,1514433626867388419,Donjuliothe4th,1015378209955811328

Once u acknowledge fans get to u it’s ball game. It’s one thing for a QB to get there’s heat on them on social media. It’s another when u chirp back via different avenues. Just don’t,1514414972452888584,Donjuliothe4th,1015378209955811328
