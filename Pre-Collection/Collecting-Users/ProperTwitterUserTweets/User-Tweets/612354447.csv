Great cues that I will be using! I love the “put your hand in your hoodie” one especially! Thanks for the tips! https://t.co/fncJslgOHT,1514250568285491205,coach_ridderbos,612354447
"I got involved in coaching because I realized the numerous opportunities it provides to have a positive impact on someone's life.
I'd love to see your reason in the comments below. https://t.co/7VnFN8d2FS",1514196703267667974,coach_ridderbos,612354447
Static stretching is largely a waste of time and can do a lot more harm than good. https://t.co/XWKnwY5d0t,1514074286134374400,coach_ridderbos,612354447
"When we find ourselves in a situation we didn't plan for, instead of making excuses &amp; complaining about it, look back &amp; reevaluate where we are &amp; where we're going then get back to work. Don't waste time &amp; energy on anything that won't keep you on the success road! https://t.co/FnR80me9Nc",1513471931336433664,coach_ridderbos,612354447
This can be a real issue and the one suffering is the athlete. It needs to go both ways. Not just one adjusting for the other. We all need to work together and figure out what is best for the athlete. It all starts by building a relationship. https://t.co/Hs2cSv3FlQ,1512972053296517125,coach_ridderbos,612354447

A dynamic warmup done with little to no intention will set the wrong tone going into the lift. If you are struggling with intention during the lift make sure the athletes are dialed in from the start of the warmup till the end of the lift. Actively coach from start to finish.,1512124769281400837,coach_ridderbos,612354447
Great explanation! Pulling up with the arms leads to the athlete pulling themselves into an improper position to receive the bar. If someone was taught to clean this way I’ve found it can be very difficult to change. I’ve seen huge increases when we are able to fix it though! https://t.co/SSlaErcS4e,1511905150935388162,coach_ridderbos,612354447
I’m really excited for this event! Thank you for the opportunity to present! Be sure to sign up if you’re free this Saturday. You won’t regret it! https://t.co/ay39O4W67P,1511767294589878274,coach_ridderbos,612354447
Intention is everything! Don't just go through the motions. Do everything with the highest intention possible. This will make things that you don't want to be doing that much easier all while giving you better results. https://t.co/yIgc9OC2Xi,1510935209629392896,coach_ridderbos,612354447
