Fantastic work young man! https://t.co/wMD0Lfz0fj,1512968989470826498,willhickmanjr,233147205
What a catch by Senzel.  Just an incredible athlete.,1512963604248735748,willhickmanjr,233147205
I have been overly critical of Kyle Wright in the past.  His performance in the WS last year and so far tonight has been incredibly encouraging.  If he can turn the corner...WOW!  #Braves,1512962325472493572,willhickmanjr,233147205
Just awful news.  RIP young man.  Condolences and prayers to his family. https://t.co/nHmux6y27P,1512812359286407174,willhickmanjr,233147205
The Reds have just dinked and dunked the Braves to death the last 2 nights.  Almost no hard contact.  Very frustrating.,1512618171420794888,willhickmanjr,233147205

Austin Riley is the TRUTH! #Braves,1512260480320032768,willhickmanjr,233147205

"Max has pitched really well tonight.  Great example of a game where the box may not reflect it, but the pitcher has been dominant.  #Braves",1512246088178278406,willhickmanjr,233147205
#Braves have stung quite a few balls tonight with little success.  Reds scored 3 off a bunch of bleeders.  Baseball!,1512242316496539649,willhickmanjr,233147205
