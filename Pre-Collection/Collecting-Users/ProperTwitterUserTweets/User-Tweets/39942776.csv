Never ceases to give me a smile to see so many UFC media accounts totally up in arms about behavior of UFC crowds. Can’t wait for the shock that comes from them when they find out taxes are due in a week #UFC273,1513031136179802117,kbonsports,39942776
And AV passed Usman tonight. P4P BITW. #UFC273,1513027307539087364,kbonsports,39942776
