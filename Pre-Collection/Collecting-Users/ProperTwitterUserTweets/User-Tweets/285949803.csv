He is still alive. Perked up &amp; purred a little when I rubbed him but still runny &amp; a little drooly. Can't tell that he has ate or drank. Held him and rubbed for a few minutes then he got back over into chair and laid down. Just trying to keep him comfortable and show he is loved.,1514808477197107203,Bonk_RDS,285949803
