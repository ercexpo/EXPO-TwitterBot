"After some issues I've been having and the stress of streaming and it going poorly, I have decided to not stream Apex for a while. This will probably persist until I get a new motherboard. I played for an hour after stream last night with no slowdown or issues. I'll try Hunt next",1510349913175040000,WilliamJBrimer1,1244966705891287041
