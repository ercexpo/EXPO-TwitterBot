"This is going to be a good year to be a McClanahan and Yordan fan…

Also, does anyone know the last time Yordan whiffed on a pitch inside the zone? You can even include Spring Training and the playoffs. https://t.co/wA2ztj8O75",1514705476822478853,JoeGentileFT,1004805260630781952
Here’s one of my deep sleeper misses. I thought this dude was just an overall solid bat and was going to pop off one year. Very hard to find a player with contact skills and raw power. https://t.co/Toq88Jb4wj,1514596517759397889,JoeGentileFT,1004805260630781952
"Shane McClanahan is so good. He’s only faced 38 batters but love seeing his 39.5% K%. 

@YancyEaton over/under 2.5 years until his first Cy Young?",1514441622192373766,JoeGentileFT,1004805260630781952
If was nice of Yordan to let Vlad get a head start in the triple crown competition this season. https://t.co/yVkCHNxaB2 https://t.co/UrSYCTmUVa,1514439560821944322,JoeGentileFT,1004805260630781952
"It’s only 17 PA but Yordan still has no strikeouts and has yet to swing and miss at a ball inside the strike zone. If he has a sub 20% K% and is healthy, then idk how he doesn’t at least contend for a triple crown.",1513872514811891721,JoeGentileFT,1004805260630781952
Bill Ripken sees no difference in these two pitches. https://t.co/ZPNlrT8Ppa,1513841046245060610,JoeGentileFT,1004805260630781952
"Reminder, Michael Lorenzen is very good and has the ability to pitch deep into games with his arsenal as long as his velo holds up. Injuries have held him back and he was never really given a chance to prove himself as a starter. https://t.co/7gWMpRwgEq",1513745844587188233,JoeGentileFT,1004805260630781952
