Baker says he wants to boo people in their cubicle. I work from home and had my toddler run in naked saying “You are Mr. Poop king!” during a conference call. We are not the same. #BAKERMAYFIELD #browns,1514321808253767691,jharlow07,285842728
I am absolutely going to give that podcast Baker went on a listen for the sole reason I want more disgruntled athletes to go on podcasts and spread the drama. High comedy.,1514281048640741376,jharlow07,285842728
Never been more proud of my son than when I asked him “When will we get a dog?” And he answered “when I clean up the poop!”,1506745196050067456,jharlow07,285842728
"Yeah don’t think the Seahawks gonna do cap magic for Mayfield. Also, the Browns fine cap wise w/ Mayfield on the books…gonna be real interesting. #Browns #BakerMayfield https://t.co/zJfCYRS19y",1506309995238932483,jharlow07,285842728
"As we watch the QB shuffle unfold can’t help but think @SandoNFL’s QB tiers article is just playing out. First Rodgers, Brady, Wilson finalize (tier 1), then Watson (1 or 2 with a BIG asterisk), then Ryan (2 or 3), next probably Jimmy (2 or 3), then the rest.",1505956911820288011,jharlow07,285842728
This week has made one thing clear: a great QB means people don’t call your front office a “disaster”. A mediocre QB who thinks he’s great will be a headache forever.,1504870925837209625,jharlow07,285842728
"Andrew Berry: has drafted well, made shrewd trades, and accurately identified that the QB position needs to be better and is working to address.            John Schneider: Drafts poorly for five years, does terrible trades, thinks you can replace RW with Drew Lock.",1504562945698717699,jharlow07,285842728
"I hope the Browns don’t trade Mayfield, get one of the other equivalent QB’s, he holds out the whole season, and they win the division. Just because chaos.",1504542694894415880,jharlow07,285842728
I’m a Seahawks fan from birth and adopted Browns fan through marriage. I’m seeing more Browns fans whine more passionately about the Browns losing Baker than the Seahawks fans about losing Russ. These #browns fans make @EvanHillHB seem rational.,1504157667236929537,jharlow07,285842728
