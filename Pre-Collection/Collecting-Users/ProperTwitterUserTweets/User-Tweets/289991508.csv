"“Mike Matheny left a mark on St. Louis” yes, f***ing up a dynasty definitely counts as leaving a mark Dan, I agree. #STLCards",1514052901332729857,KcJ1394,289991508
I’ve said it for quite some time. I love Yadi obviously but Knizner has needed more at bats for quite some time. Huge homer for him there! #STLCards,1514046818438594565,KcJ1394,289991508
Not to overreact in April but the Brewers are looking like a fraud.,1514028569474875393,KcJ1394,289991508
"Steven Matz fits well with this defense if he can induce ground balls. Uhm, problem he is not inducing said ground balls. #STLCards",1513231845613314051,KcJ1394,289991508
Nolan Arenado is a St. Louis Cardinal. Unreal start for him. #STLCards,1513223594486251522,KcJ1394,289991508

"I like the Cardinals bullpen, but in game 2 you needed 5 innings from the bullpen already. I am no genius but that typically, typically causes issues when a bullpen gets taxed early in the year. Again, not a genius but you may want to get more arms to eat innings Mo. #STLCards",1512910230199353350,KcJ1394,289991508
