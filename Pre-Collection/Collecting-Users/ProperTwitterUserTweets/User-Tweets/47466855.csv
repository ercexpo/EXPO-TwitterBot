"That Sebastian River, Park Vista, and Dwyer stretch we were lights out on defense. We were so locked in as a unit.",1514603313890693127,Coach_Gilkes,47466855
"During the season it is always hard to reflect on things because you are always worried about the next game, but while doing my annual self scouting seeing the improvement we made as a defense was awesome. Everyone settled in their roles after the 1st quarter of the Inlet game.",1514597815929868292,Coach_Gilkes,47466855
