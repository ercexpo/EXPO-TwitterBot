It seems @screenrant knows what's up. Notice the screenshot referenced. We've not seen the last of those two in those roles. #ReleaseTheAyerCut #RestoreTheSnyderVerse @wbd https://t.co/5XeDPOg072,1514677779362725898,carlchomko,17772523
"A great candidate for this role would be @JimLee. I think @ZackSnyder would be cool for it, but I think he has a lot going on in other places (like Netflix) and he enjoys those other universes as well. #ReleaseTheAyerCut #RestoreTheSnyderVerse @wbd https://t.co/8rHM5M1ajE",1514677230911303682,carlchomko,17772523

I've only seen #TheBatman in theaters since COVID-19 got real in the US (last film prior was Birds of Prey either late Feb or early March 2020). I would DEFINITELY go see ZSJL in theaters. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse @wbd https://t.co/xzqxUavwDg,1514614659772399616,carlchomko,17772523
