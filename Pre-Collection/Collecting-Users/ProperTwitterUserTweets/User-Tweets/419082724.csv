Ben highlights a TE the #Packers have met with in the past month. I know everyone is infatuated with Jelani Woods but here is another day 2 option. https://t.co/Ql8LShxvSp,1514668468762812426,PackerScribe,419082724
"Also, signing Sammy Watkins wouldn’t alter the #Packers draft in any way, shape, or form.",1514645424342241283,PackerScribe,419082724
"Injuries have not been kind to Sammy Watkins, who has not played a full season since his rookie year. However, a healthy Watkins would add much-needed speed to the Packers offense. Sprinkling in veterans while adding through the draft is a good way to build a WR room post-Adams.",1514641058914779138,PackerScribe,419082724
Rich Bisaccia does not disappoint. I hope this is the start of a new trend. https://t.co/KF5kw5QQKY,1513907575745654795,PackerScribe,419082724
USFL teams? https://t.co/Fvqkn8bnq3,1513674167022931968,PackerScribe,419082724
Cobb? Overrated? No. Just terrible injury luck. https://t.co/D2UpZauktU,1513353484623622144,PackerScribe,419082724
"Kind of surprising to look back and see Randall Cobb had only one 1,000-yard season. Goes to show how valuable even a receiver can be without huge numbers.",1513337516056891394,PackerScribe,419082724
Anyone else get Dwayne Bowe vibes from Treylon Burks?,1512137324414611457,PackerScribe,419082724
Definitely agree after a deeper dive. Kind of top heavy and no clear alpha. https://t.co/8iy0DCvo12,1511427582851489793,PackerScribe,419082724
Really liked Enagbare’s tape despite his poor showing at the combine. Still like him as a day two option for the #Packers. https://t.co/y3iVMV9Maw,1511394872405676046,PackerScribe,419082724
