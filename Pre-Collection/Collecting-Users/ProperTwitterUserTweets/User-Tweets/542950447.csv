"Seeing Michelle Yeoh finally getting her flowers in Hollywood with #EverythingEverywhere 

It really makes me wish Maggie Cheung wasn't retired

It especially makes me wish Anita Mui was still alive to see

"I loved Jackass Forever, but honestly by ""Jackass Standards""  It was pretty tame compared to the other films. Even though critics shockingly like this movie the best of the franchise, I would still say its only the 4th best ( even though I loved it )",1514717907342790656,chainer2111,542950447

"You can tell that cast, the directors/producers, everyone involved with this movie has a true deep love for this material. This is what you get, when you don't disrespect the source material to try and only appeal to one audience

You can tell amazing stories and appeal to all! https://t.co/XbDqdhiekI",1514610302565814274,chainer2111,542950447
