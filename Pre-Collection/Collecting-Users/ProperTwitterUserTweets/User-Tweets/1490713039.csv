"No! No! Don't do that!

Seriously, having a Feige overlord is gonna seem great to begin with but you're actively sacrificing creativity for synergy!

I'll take incoherent and wildly creative DC over a coherent and monotonous DC any day of the fucking week. https://t.co/FfapqtteJ7",1514673704080326674,DeathByCinema22,1490713039
"The third episode of #MoonKnight was far, FAR better than Episode 2. I still...am not the biggest fan of how Mr. Knight is being utilized, but the tone and pacing of this episode were far more consistent. Seriously love how complex they're allowing Khonshu to be. https://t.co/SVOFoupKeN",1514404992454643719,DeathByCinema22,1490713039

I was lax on animated kids movies because they were ""for kids"". Now I'm adamantly against lazy storytelling for kids. https://t.co/Ftb3fRucmc",1514124379113902084,DeathByCinema22,1490713039
"Paul Verhoeven says that James Bond needs to fuck more in future movies. I couldn't agree more, but there's a condition. I'll only watch James Bond get his 007 on if Verhoeven is the one directing it. Seriously, give me some classic Verhoeven tension and the first Rated-R Bond. https://t.co/VCX3y9x5ug",1514092931522736130,DeathByCinema22,1490713039
"Nah because these designs are FIRE. Good heavens, I almost feel like we were robbed of something really special. https://t.co/vvm4SOE7bH",1514039855306752004,DeathByCinema22,1490713039
