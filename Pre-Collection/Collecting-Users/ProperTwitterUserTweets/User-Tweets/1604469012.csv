"Mets shortstop prospect Ronny Mauricio came out of tonight‚Äôs game after taking a pitch off his left ankle in the ninth inning.

Looked precautionary as he was able to walk off under his own power, albeit slowly.

Mauricio is hitting .320 on the early season.",1514788191940739075,Jacob_Resnick,1604469012
