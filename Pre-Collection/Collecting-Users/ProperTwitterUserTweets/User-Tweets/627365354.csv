Our kids are amazing - we have a #SpringBreak challenge -- anyone who earns 20 @LexiaLearning units or solves 150 @STMath puzzles over the entire week will celebrate at an ice cream party when we return.  Keep up the amazing work everyone!! #SSSct https://t.co/WpA0MHVhja,1513906233039851529,DavidJHuber,627365354
