"Sounds like it'll be a remaster, not a remake
I don't think it'll be Kid Icarus Uprising (though I would absolutely LOVE that) as a game going from 3DS to Switch (especially with the controls) would probably need more of a remake, not just visual polish. https://t.co/LWOcQRrlqc",1514096389378166785,TimRopple,626906414

"I wish I could say I was excited for Kingdom Hearts 4, but I have yet to play any of the games

"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 to me was like the first one: really fun and enjoyable but they should have focused more on Sonic (and now Tails and Knuckles) and Robotnik and less on the humans
Though this movie does a MUCH better job of it than it's predecessor and is just better overall",1512785857538842625,TimRopple,626906414
"Capcom
I would reboot Deadrising with a new entry that leans heavily into what made the first one so great (forget 3 and ESPECIALLY 4)
