"Everything is a global phenomenon these days. It doesn’t make ZSJL any more special 🤷🏽‍♂️

That “award” isn’t really worth anything. Did you get an Oscar through the mail?🤷🏽‍♂️

My HBO Max crashed today while rewatching Gossip Girl. Was it also a global phenomenon? 🤷🏽‍♂️

Oof someone’s not happy that Discovery is floating farther and farther away from the snyderverse as more of Zaslav’s plans unravel 😂😂 https://t.co/nOasgvMKBs,1514779311315709971,dcstan07,3983883912
Okay like hella unpopular opinion but he kinda nailed that 👀 It’s creepy like how Joker is supposed to be idk 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/Osk27z0c8p,1514717518883012608,dcstan07,3983883912
I mean I’m all for potentially spinning DC Films off as its own studio UNDER Warner Bros. Discovery but this little excerpt concerns me. I think we all know what happens when the person in-charge isn’t a fan of the material and solely cares about the money coming in 🥴 https://t.co/JDXPSOEBB9 https://t.co/dUiH5yNE67,1514673370612207616,dcstan07,3983883912
"Not people body shaming someone just because they don't like him. Big yikes. This is an unverified image of Dream. It could be him it could be a completely different person. The same people hating on Dream for ""toxic fans"" come up with bs like this...🙄 https://t.co/O5grn4TCgs",1514666045272821766,dcstan07,3983883912
"Like seriously, what is wrong with Snyder fans??? Damn!🥴 What did gay people do to you?? https://t.co/VKLNKXeIjc",1514618269054877698,dcstan07,3983883912
Is #HaloTheSeries even good? Kinda curious to see how it looks but I don’t have Paramount+ 😬,1514408565011673092,dcstan07,3983883912
"Goddamn some of the most vocal amongst staunch Snyder supporters are either fucking insensitive making 9/11 jokes on fuckin 9/11, homophobic like fucking Geralt, fake news peddlers like Mikey and Syl, and also racist like this one 👇🏽. Sheesh i feel sorry for Zack.🥴 https://t.co/i41D1WSP9b",1514284258570883072,dcstan07,3983883912
Funny how this is still up and hasn’t been retracted yet. Not even a disclaimer that it in fact has NOT been cancelled but rescheduled after the movie it follows was also rescheduled to a later date. What happened to responsible journalism? 🥴 https://t.co/uw68t5YfQf,1514008352824520704,dcstan07,3983883912
Please I peeked for a few minutes into this Heard-Depp trial and oof boy. I don't want to assume or anything but i think Heard's lawyers are doing a good job here. I'm concerned.,1513972255402823683,dcstan07,3983883912
