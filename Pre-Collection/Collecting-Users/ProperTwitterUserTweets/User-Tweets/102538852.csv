"At least we got to enjoy this interesting food item on the way out of ATL. Fried Chicken, Bacon and Eggs. In between a waffle topped with Chicken Sausage Gravy.  #brunch #food #foodphotography @AtlBreakfastClb https://t.co/8Rube6CjhA",1514775593044230152,jsk1030,102538852
0/3 once again on the Holo drops from today. Perhaps @nbatopshot can introduce some type of system that increases your chances for every time you miss on a prior drop. Would be nice if I could acquire a legendary moment at some point. #NBATopShotThis #NBA #NFT,1514712580891238401,jsk1030,102538852
This seems like how my luck has been for all these Rare and Legendary drops. Hopefully some better luck on the next one. @TISSOT @nbatopshot #NBATopShotThis #TissotBuzzerBeater https://t.co/94HVfnkHwx https://t.co/Unq4Pd0M9U,1514656667467759626,jsk1030,102538852
Stock market is reacting to the Hornets game yesterday. Just a sea of red. #Hornets #StockMarket #trading,1514648427497459712,jsk1030,102538852

Last post of the night. Atlanta has the worst fans in the world. Trash all around. Security doesn’t care about harassment at all. Fan just said to us we ain’t making it out of here alive. Great staff here. @ATLHawks @hornets @StateFarmArena #Hornets #AllFly #NBA,1514407691640311809,jsk1030,102538852
Haven’t looked at a single stat for the half. Feel like we missed a lot of easy buckets. Down 8… we are a third quarter team. Let’s get it. #Hornets #AllFly #NBA https://t.co/qhDbO20en2,1514400469279555585,jsk1030,102538852
Hornets ain’t getting any calls. No foul on this. You be the judge. @CrownClubCLT #hornets #AllFly #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/czj5m5CQx2,1514399548491411457,jsk1030,102538852
