Saw @EugeneMirman last night and he was great as always. I think this is the third or fourth time I’ve seen him live. Had to listen to some binaural beats when I got home.,1514798737972817925,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
So psyched for all the fun stuff going on in my life! Loving being less #depressed.,1514797138768633856,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
Surprising my fiancé with this. Can’t wait. Also does it need to be a surprise? The actual logistics and content of the date are going to be a total surprise for both of us. #mysterypicnic https://t.co/iMNFJXrDA7,1514796304337027078,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
"My 83 year old Aunt just commented on my new fb profile pic, “SEXY HAIR GREAT LOOK” so I think I’m doing something right.",1514617844905897997,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
Getting shit done and then lying on the couch so I have the mental energy to get more shit done later.,1513879803253997568,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
"I hate those memes, videos that pit “real” women against “fake” women. “No girl has all three: real nails, real eyelashes, real hair.” You know what bullshit I’m talking about right? It is pitting women against women and needs to stop.",1513595818443526145,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
Do five minutes. I’ve been frozen for hours. I just need to do five damn minutes of mail organizing damn it! https://t.co/1PXDyTHuyp,1513241194704347161,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
Oh no! Apparently my fb friends can see my comments on my fb #kdrama groups now somehow. My Aunt just voted for Lee Min-ho as the most handsome out of him Park Seo-joon and Song Joong-ki. I mean I agree but I don’t want her to see group stuff because fandom can be hella weird.,1513188121046831108,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
My fiancé asked how we celebrate #WetDay and I’m clueless. I told him many traditions are bound to be born today. #ComedyBangBang @ComedyBangBang @ScottAukerman @PFTompkins,1513141737681735682,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
I have to stop feeling guilty every time I have to stand up and disturb the #cat. He doesn’t even pay rent. https://t.co/nvJPLv0dOG,1512203976925749253,HappyMrsRory2,31144382
