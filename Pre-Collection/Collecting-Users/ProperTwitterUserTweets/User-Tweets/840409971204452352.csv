"I believe if the #Texans were to draft Jordan Davis in the first, he would be an absolute monster in Lovie’s system. He will asked to do more gap filling instead of read and react 2 gapping like at Georgia. The notion that you can find his talent later in the draft is asinine imo",1514730905755172866,FB_LoneStar,840409971204452352

"During a mock draft on YT, Brett Koleman mentions that he knows the Texans like Kyle Hamilton “alot”

Half of y’all will love it, the other half will hate it. It’s interesting to say the least.

(They mocked Ikem at 3 and Hamilton at 13) https://t.co/zQwKmI2LUY",1513836279741521920,FB_LoneStar,840409971204452352
"While Ikem isn’t my first choice at pick 3, this is exactly why i have no issue with the Texans taking him at 3. You can’t pass on someone with as much potential and versatility as Ikem *IF* he is your PBA, regardless of the positional value. Just my .02 https://t.co/dHqIxOvQIc",1512784721218097161,FB_LoneStar,840409971204452352
