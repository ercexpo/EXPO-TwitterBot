I— I don’t know how I feel about this 😐 https://t.co/Ezgcmn8x1z,1514737679753256967,Laura_Christie3,139797804
"Rules? Nope just boundaries set until HE is able to decide how to address you all, but you won’t tell your followers that. https://t.co/AyaADG43po",1514737527365771270,Laura_Christie3,139797804
Everything except respect Sarah &amp; Kody as his parents and respect their boundaries for their son. https://t.co/E0GTSB4Iwv,1514736996933111813,Laura_Christie3,139797804
The way you speak about Bennett is a big reason you don’t deserve to be in his life. “Forced birth” “lack of abortion centers” “my family was complete”. You never wanted him until you saw how great he was doing with Sarah &amp; Kody. https://t.co/FIil6G1lpI,1514736752963072005,Laura_Christie3,139797804
You love playing the victim. YOU &amp; YOUR HUSBAND sought out Sarah &amp; Kody to take the child you didn’t want &amp; wanted to abort. They did YOU a favor by taking him. He’s THRIVING with his parents. Your attempts to uproot him will only cause trauma you’re so desperate to free him from https://t.co/5buZWh7KIp,1514736374934556679,Laura_Christie3,139797804
