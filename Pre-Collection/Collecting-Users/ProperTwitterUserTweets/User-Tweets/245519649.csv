"Interesting wrinkle on the Joely Rodriguez/Miguel Castro trade between #Mets and #Yankees: because Rodriguez signed as a free agent, he was not eligible to be traded prior to June 15 without consenting to the deal…",1510656244553551873,Adams_Steve,245519649
"#Dodgers just traded their left fielder and have a fairly righty-heavy lineup at a time when Michael Conforto is still looking for a landing spot.

Just sayin'.",1509934514423926792,Adams_Steve,245519649
"In a ""this won't happen but I enjoy offseason chaos"" scenario...

Would be a nifty bow to put on the Twins' offseason if they moved an OF to the Padres in exchange for a big league rotation piece, then signed Michael Conforto.",1509538030327152650,Adams_Steve,245519649
"Can confirm that right-hander JC Ramirez signed a minor league deal with #MNTwins recently. More rotation depth.

Parts of six MLB seasons, mostly with #Angels. Had Tommy John surgery in 2018 and has pitched in Mexico and Taiwan the past couple seasons. https://t.co/z4PQYbIN0R",1509513908842868740,Adams_Steve,245519649

Most teams will be more incentivized to bring their top prospects up earlier, but a blatantly tanking team like PIT or BAL might go the opposite direction... https://t.co/LOl3n93C1y",1508903571600859136,Adams_Steve,245519649
"Pointing to Pujols’ raw HR/PA ignores that he’s homered that frequently due largely to being heavily platooned.

He shouldn’t get 419 PAs anyway, but if he saw a normal split of RHP and LHP, that rate probably drops off quickly. He’s homered once every 32 PA vs RHP in that time. https://t.co/GuFeoUqKL0",1508517621129437186,Adams_Steve,245519649
