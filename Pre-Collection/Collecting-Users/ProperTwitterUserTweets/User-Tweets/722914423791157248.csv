"Ryan pace signed AGING VETS TO BAD MEGA DEALS.. Missed on Trubisky (Most Critical) &amp; signed injured stars who gave no impact in 1st yr on roster.. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s pretty damn different, Also the players Pace was signing on 1yr deals were duds and guys who were camp bodies..

Ryan Poles is a GENIUS!! He signs guys to 1yr prove it deals with them knowing #DaBears are going to lead the NFL in cap space next year. Can be a virtual lottery ticket for any player willing to show he can ball he will get PAID ðŸ’°.. Moving like this will make the roster better!,1514401648864550913,DeVourieNesbySr,722914423791157248
