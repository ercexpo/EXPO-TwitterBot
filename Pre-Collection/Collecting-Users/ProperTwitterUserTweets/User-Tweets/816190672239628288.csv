Devin Hester for my age group. Probably Jacoby Brissett or Geno Smith for the group right after https://t.co/NaVLnboRbI,1514712345406279680,WillRouse3,816190672239628288
What I don't understand is why buddy's videos make it to every social media platform. People do way more outlandish shit for likes https://t.co/xnlQsKtkIC,1514688585361932288,WillRouse3,816190672239628288
Probably Ekwonu. Fits the new run scheme perfectly https://t.co/s84f4sm14D,1514652250509041682,WillRouse3,816190672239628288
I don't think Freiermuth is impactful enough to really be stressed over it either way https://t.co/S2b54tFaSs,1514613471798693888,WillRouse3,816190672239628288

"If the Jags REALLY wanna bet on traits and upside, Troy Andersen at 33 makes sense. Freak athlete with only one year of full-time play at MIKE. Smart player as a former safety and quarterback.
