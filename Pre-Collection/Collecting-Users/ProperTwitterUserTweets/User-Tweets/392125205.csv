I really liked Bri Steves performance. She may be my favorite r&amp;b artist in the competition so far. #AmericanSongContest,1513694975413923842,kingrichard256,392125205
Las Marias have something special going! #AmericanSongContest,1513692916203589636,kingrichard256,392125205
Alexis Cunningham is my favorite performance so far tonight. Love her voice! Song was a catchy tune too. #AmericanSongContest,1513691232509308933,kingrichard256,392125205
I did not care for Stella Cole’s song. Bronson Varde on the other hand was quite enjoyable. #AmericanSongContest,1513689208921243652,kingrichard256,392125205
Jared Lee brought the show tonight. Woah.,1513681656128974853,kingrichard256,392125205
I feel like Neither’s studio version is gonna be 20x better than the live one. #AmericanSongContest,1513677978856828936,kingrichard256,392125205
