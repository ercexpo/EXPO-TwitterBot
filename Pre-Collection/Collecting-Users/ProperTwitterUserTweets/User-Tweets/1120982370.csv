"Robin Robin (2021) ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
A young, orphaned robin bird raised by a family of mice is determined to prove them that she can be a good ""mouse"". From the #Aardman Animation Studios, this is a charming and enjoyable short that cleverly handles issues of identity and belonging. https://t.co/M9FGwioTaq",1514268070608523272,ThiefCGT,1120982370

"#Attica (2021) ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
Oscar-nominated docu about the tragic 1971 riot at the facility. My knowledge was limited to the ""catchy quote"" from Dog Day Afternoon, so it was eye-opening to see it as a real tragedy that impacted the community, the prison system &amp; the individuals in it https://t.co/ndTY1Cz7Or",1513620911437623296,ThiefCGT,1120982370
