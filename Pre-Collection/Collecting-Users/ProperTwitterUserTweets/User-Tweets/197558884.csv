I still want the real Richard Pryor biopic which was originally supposed to be played my Marlon Wayans. That's the film I wanna see. Make it hot!!!! Do you feel me!? @MarlonWayans gets lost in characters that's why people remember his performances. Audition video is fire!! https://t.co/jSszkqhR7b,1514512275670896645,Roninjoegenji85,197558884
