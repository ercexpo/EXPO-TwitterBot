I agree here 100%. You simply can’t pull Kershaw unless he said he was done or felt pain or something of that nature. Is 80 pitches vs a potential 100 pitches or 105 going to make much of a difference when HISTORY is on the line? Still can’t wrap my head around pulling him 😵‍💫 https://t.co/db0yWtoAtr,1514621790802358274,MetsAvenue,747981800903946240
