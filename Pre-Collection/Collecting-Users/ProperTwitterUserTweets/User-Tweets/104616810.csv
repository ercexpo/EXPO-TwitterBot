"Didn’t catch the game today due to work, but I see Dubon played. Were there any brushback pitches or any extracurriculars that stemmed from yesterday’s incident? 🤔 #SFGiants",1514448034549026816,FraserKnowsBest,104616810
What’s everyone’s opinion on “unwritten rules” in baseball? Are they stupid? Needed? Out of date? Let’s discuss. #MLB,1514421230182428673,FraserKnowsBest,104616810

The #SFGiants have themselves a pair of dealers in Rodon &amp; Cobb. Both guys piling up the K’s in their SF debuts. ⛽️🔥 #SFGameUp,1514087151750705154,FraserKnowsBest,104616810

"Ballgame! #SFGiants win the rubber-match. Great work by the bullpen, picking up a less than stellar DeSclafani. #SFGiants #SFGameUp",1513289255119843329,FraserKnowsBest,104616810
