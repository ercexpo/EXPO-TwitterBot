I just cant do it with some of yâ€™all titans fans. Some of yâ€™all are the biggest crybabies Iâ€™ve ever seen. Whining constantly. Titans got yâ€™all spoiled as hell. What a miserable way to fan.,1514675232237359111,jaredfarmer1987,1221237644560097280

I see we reached the point of the season on titans twitter where we convince ourselves Trevor Penning should be and will be the pick at 26. ðŸ™ˆ,1513957375300050959,jaredfarmer1987,1221237644560097280
