"A heads up to all those that supported our fundraising effort. Today is the first of our trips with that cash.

We are taking 21 kids to the cinema to see a film of their choosing, to the beach for stupid games &amp; the arcades for more idiotic fun, all without charging them a penny",1514523052708708353,todderov28,269838380

"Postie had a very confused look on his face when he was handing over a parcel and said ""Todderov?""

"The discovery of Ben Gardner's boat is one of the most atmospheric pieces of cinema ever shot.

This film is the perfect length. Needs nothing adding, couldn't take anything away. No wasted minutes.

You're gonna need a bigger boat is iconic and not even top in the top 5 moments. https://t.co/Vge5zlkjci",1514256976485797888,todderov28,269838380
"I've always really liked Jaws. It's been a film I've watched from a (too) young age. It wasn't until I saw it on the big screen that I became completely enamoured with it. When I watched it on a monthly basis.

"It's a matter of opinion.

I'm off to Sainsbury's, they think I need to pay for the stuff I'm getting but I think it's perfectly lawful for me to walk out.

I'm going to drive at 90mph the whole way. I think it's perfectly lawful.
