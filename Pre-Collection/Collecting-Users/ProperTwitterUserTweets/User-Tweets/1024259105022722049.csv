"I’ve been saying it since last year,  Gleybor does not deserve to be playing infield with this team.  He is incredibly overrated.  DJ is my second basemen.  #MLB #Yankees #YankeesTwitter #RepBX @BBronxbaseball3 @scottsoB3",1514583663282954246,notter39,1024259105022722049
"New game plan,  Cole is not allowed to pitch to Vladdy Jr ever again and he will be fine.  #YankeesTwitter #yankees #MLB #RepBX",1514406642728722437,notter39,1024259105022722049
Ok I’m gonna start tweeting about the hitting more.  WOW we just woke up! #RepBX,1514403722281078788,notter39,1024259105022722049
"Everyone is shitting on Cole, I get it.  But not one person is talking about the bats in the lineup.  If Cole goes 6 and only gives up 3 runs, it’s a good start people.  Especially this early in the season.  Wake up Yankee Fans.  #yankees #YankeesTwitter #RepBX #MLB",1514397195839102982,notter39,1024259105022722049
"Great pitch by Cole, Vladdy is just an absolute monster.",1514393056719642634,notter39,1024259105022722049
Ok that one was a home run,1514392569341431811,notter39,1024259105022722049
That wasn’t a home run just saying.,1514386289528909825,notter39,1024259105022722049
Pulling Kershaw after 80 pitches and 7 innings is a crime.  What a story that could have been.  #MLB #baseball #ladodgers,1514327977311748096,notter39,1024259105022722049
