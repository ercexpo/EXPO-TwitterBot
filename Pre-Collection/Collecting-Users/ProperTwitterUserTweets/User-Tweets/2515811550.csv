"The second the Bruins had a chance to really do something in the Atlantic they disintegrated.

Yes a lot of it is injuries. But they’ve also had a lead in 5 straight and won once. #NHLBruins https://t.co/p8yjOEtFuh",1514790528323182604,VanAlanClark,2515811550
"I did not like Nosek at 3LW at all.

I know he’s not really here to score but he literally hasn’t scored in half a season. #NHLBruins https://t.co/PNmPwHyh5E",1514789479415881736,VanAlanClark,2515811550
"I mean, this is a big part of it……

You also could play better. #NHLBruins https://t.co/CCUQWKAoDl",1514788270072217605,VanAlanClark,2515811550
If their power play weren’t literally the worst thing I have ever seen this is 5-game winning streak. #NHLBruins https://t.co/JlgvaJ7Yi3,1514788033991614473,VanAlanClark,2515811550
"It’s bad that Nick Foligno was literally the Bruins best player tonight.

Where is Marchand. Has he been active the last 5-games? #NHLBruins https://t.co/1Rl2fBs3dP",1514787774926188547,VanAlanClark,2515811550
"The Bruins best players have not been their best players the past 5 games.

Leads in 5 straight games. Managed one OT win. And your goalie is hurt. #NHLBruins",1514786499564171271,VanAlanClark,2515811550
"You got goals from Marc McLaughlin and Jesper Froden, guys who’ve been here for like 12 games combined. Your best players let you down. Again. #NHLBruins",1514786191920443393,VanAlanClark,2515811550
Bruce started the 2nd unit. They got a couple good looks. 1st unit comes out. Promptly gives up a shorthanded 2-on-1 and a breakaway. These are your best players. You can’t have this. #NHLBruins,1514784628736815104,VanAlanClark,2515811550
How many breakaways are you gonna make Swayman stop boys? #NHLBruins,1514781357146222609,VanAlanClark,2515811550
0-for-4 on the PP. All they did was give Conor Brown a shorthanded breakaway. Unacceptable at this level. Pro hockey players have no excuse for being this bad. #NHLBruins,1514780507900313605,VanAlanClark,2515811550
