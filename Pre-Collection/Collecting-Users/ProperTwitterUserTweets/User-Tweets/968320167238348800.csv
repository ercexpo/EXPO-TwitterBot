The rise of gator great @TampaBayTre in the draft community has been exponential and I’m here for it! https://t.co/h9paVXMxD6,1514015010376278026,MTScouting,968320167238348800
"Zonovan Knight had a lot of success returning kicks in college (3 TDs the last two years on 30 returns, 31 yard average, and led the FBS in kick return average this year at 34.4). He’d be a fine usage of a 4th/5th round pick. Love his fit, too. Virgil could be all-pro though. https://t.co/45qjxKpVfd",1511843809398775816,MTScouting,968320167238348800
If your team needs a kick returner then you’re messing up if he’s not on your radar. https://t.co/V4xLKaLl0e,1511834427126652936,MTScouting,968320167238348800
If he’s available day-3 then I think he’d be a perfect compliment to Javonte in Denver. Probably fits the scheme better than Javonte and adds serious juice to the run game. I loved the Melvin/Javonte duo in 2021 but I’d be down for a Javonte/Strong (or Badie) combo going forward https://t.co/lYeJHxty6s,1509174881409290252,MTScouting,968320167238348800
"Two things can be true: 
1. Kyle Hamilton’s tape is exquisite 2. Lackluster athletic testing is worth noting.

There are many overstating the significance of his 40 time but I also think many are pushing back a bit too harshly and not considering the athletic profile enough.",1508856550215102465,MTScouting,968320167238348800
I think this is a great outcome. I don’t mind regular season games having the current rules but it’s a shame when a team exits the playoffs without getting the all in OT. https://t.co/C9JoZoT0qt,1508846009056739334,MTScouting,968320167238348800

I think we are underselling the chances he goes top-10 https://t.co/pPgFMLqxcm,1507364085951782912,MTScouting,968320167238348800
The amount of WR talent Tua will play with in his career is astounding https://t.co/HBRVxDMHeE,1506671179922354181,MTScouting,968320167238348800
"Mekhi and 10 is a nice deal for both teams. I get a bit antsy as a Broncos fan if they get Becton and either Jameson, Wilson, or an elite edge falling down the board plus the cap implications. I could see this move setting up KC nicely. Could also see it ending in regret. https://t.co/gNyqIl4aLL",1506662282142564364,MTScouting,968320167238348800
