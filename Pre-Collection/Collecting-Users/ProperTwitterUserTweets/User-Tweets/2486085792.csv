Camilo Doval keeps shaking the fastball. The confidence level he has in that pitch is undeniably questionable. #SFGiants,1514362059793731590,StevenRissotto,2486085792
"Kapler’s “win the series” strategy he discussed isn’t some thoughtless cliché. There some truth to it. The Giants are trying to drain the Padres pitching staff, not only to to help them for the next game, but also in the standings in hopes SD plays with a tired pitching staff.",1514268182554546176,StevenRissotto,2486085792
Brandon Crawford left tonight’s game after his wrist bent back on a stolen base attempt. Gabe Kapler said he may need a day off tomorrow but they’re going to wait and see. #SFGiants,1514147703449546759,StevenRissotto,2486085792
Kapler on a possible retaliation scenario: “I don't think anybody in MLB wants to throw it other people. There's no place for that in the game. What our club has discussed is that we can only control ourselves. We want to keep our side of the street clean.” #SFGiants,1514146308436606977,StevenRissotto,2486085792
"Alex Cobb said he didn’t realize Alyssa Nakken was even at first until after the game: “I didn't even see that until everybody was giving her a hug after the game and I asked what happened and saw that she made history. So cool, so happy for her. What a wonderful person.”",1514144639145570305,StevenRissotto,2486085792
Everybody we talked to in the clubhouse after the game had the same response regarding unwritten rules: “we’re focused on winning series.” Every single individual said those words. #SFGiants,1514142940687319043,StevenRissotto,2486085792
"Offensive explosion, a great debut from Cobb, unwritten rule shenanigans and some history. #SFGiants beat #Padres tonight 13-2. My latest for @sfbay:

Wil Myers singled. He's the first National League pitcher to single in the DH era.,1514105740926939140,StevenRissotto,2486085792
