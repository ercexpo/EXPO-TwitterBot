"The most bone chilling two words in sports are basically happening in CLEVELAND FRIDAY! Not opening day, no. It's GAME 7! Though Friday isn't called it, it's win or go home! That's a game 7! Let's go #Cavs",1514056702747975685,Iwashazed03,951281392226205696
A superb performance by #Cavs tonight. They should feel encouraged by their efforts and feel good for Friday's elimination game at home.,1514053440355381254,Iwashazed03,951281392226205696
"Dragic just put some defense on @dariusgarland22 and it was absolutely ""nuts!"" Wowy go #Cavs",1514045884694208520,Iwashazed03,951281392226205696
The #Cavs never quit and just keep playing hard. Love to see it.,1514042767101595648,Iwashazed03,951281392226205696

#cavs @cavs for anyone not believing these aren't the playoffs they are totally wrong! There are seedings. Four teams vying for two spots. Elimination games. Last time I checked you have elimination game 7s. So don't haves and  #defendtheland #allin,1513942617565900803,Iwashazed03,951281392226205696
Steven Kwan has Hats for Bats to keep bats warm. Thank you Cerrano for the advice to future Indians.... I mean #Guardians and for waking up the bats today! https://t.co/VsgqOpnHx2,1513326766684876814,Iwashazed03,951281392226205696
