"Elon Musk is a snake...

Dude buys ~73M shares of TWTR at ~$39.25/share...it shoots up to ~$53/share before falling back down to earth over the last week. 

IMO This offer to buy the company (at a modest 20% premium) is a ploy to drive the price back up so he can dump his shares. https://t.co/j8fa5Say33",1514598850136199177,SotoC803,79095195
