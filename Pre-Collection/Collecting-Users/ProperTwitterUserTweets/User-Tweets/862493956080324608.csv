The Met vs. Philly fan is an interesting study. I'd say while throwing the phone into the field is excessive... the Mets fan celebrating and recording the guy while getting up close is unnecessary celebration. Now we don't know what all happened prior to this of course.,1514632505726574601,JazuFF,862493956080324608
