"This umpire is the classic example why there should be an electronic strike zone.  Two balls were strikes, than the next one, in the exact same spot, ball. @RedSox",1513306304512679941,janredsoxkelly,448498557
I don‚Äôt understand why @nesn can‚Äôt have their usual pregame shows for @RedSox and @NHLBruins even when they‚Äôre on national networks.  This network gets worse by the day‚Ä¶.,1513281649836011527,janredsoxkelly,448498557

"Phew..  this opening dialogue by Dave O‚ÄôBrien about Jerry Remy just did me in..  I‚Äôm so old I remember him playing, and then partnering with Ned Martin in the booth.  indeed it will be strange not to hear his voice.  #redsox",1512476716467376133,janredsoxkelly,448498557
