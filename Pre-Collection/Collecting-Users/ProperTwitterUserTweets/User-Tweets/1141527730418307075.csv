Burnes robbed of a win.,1514417647869472771,Wisco___Nation,1141527730418307075
Old enough to remember when Minnesota fans thought KAT would be better than Giannis. He just fouled out while going 3-11 in a big game at home lol.,1514091636757876737,Wisco___Nation,1141527730418307075
The @NBAOfficial’s call way too many fouls. This is brutal and it’s the same every game. No one enjoys this.,1514086079757959170,Wisco___Nation,1141527730418307075
Is there anyone in the league more unlikable than Pat Bev? I would accept Harden as an answer but that’s about it.,1514083278726250504,Wisco___Nation,1141527730418307075
Winner! #ThisIsMyCrew,1514072285115731978,Wisco___Nation,1141527730418307075
George Hill and I laughing about Pat Bev getting 3 fouls in the first quarter.,1514066448477573130,Wisco___Nation,1141527730418307075
I don’t forget Timberwolves fans acting like they won the NBA Finals after beating us without Giannis playing. Go Clippers.,1514065947547549699,Wisco___Nation,1141527730418307075
