"Once y’all get over the initial emotions, it really doesn’t make a lot of sense for Luka to play in game 1. If we lose, game 2 is a must-win",1514672418266169354,bg901,29760371
Remember Luka’s long-term health is much more important than this series.,1514668217817616384,bg901,29760371
"If Luka misses the first two games, Mavs are in a world of trouble. But he could miss the whole series. He could not miss any time. We just don’t know. A couple days away. https://t.co/q4ELiVxoc0",1514621532844212234,bg901,29760371

Lamelo has a lot of flash to his game. But he has the recklessness to his game too. It’s pretty when it’s working but when it’s not it looks awful.,1514409287979880457,bg901,29760371
The great players make the game look easy. You look at Trae and think it’s easy. That’s what I love about him offensively.,1514408674663583746,bg901,29760371
I don’t know what Lamelo out there doing,1514396257795846144,bg901,29760371
I am NOT a fan of the play-in. They could’ve kept this shit,1514389690392231937,bg901,29760371
Lamelo with some stupid stuff there. Should’ve been a foul,1514389306659454987,bg901,29760371
Hawks win by a million. I don’t even care about the last game.,1514378217158754305,bg901,29760371
