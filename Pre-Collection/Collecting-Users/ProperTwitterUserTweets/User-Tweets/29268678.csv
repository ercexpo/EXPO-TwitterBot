"Glad they are finally being responsible by saying they believe he wasnâ€™t the shooter instead of messing up a personâ€™s reputation in the court of public opinion by insinuating that he was like other news sites do.

"Finally found the most detailed, informative, nuanced and unbiased Comparison video of MJ &amp; Lebron that will leave you with information you had no idea about for both Players. Itâ€™s a Must See!

"I donâ€™t understand why everyone acts like Jerry Jones is telling the Media what the actual Draft Plans are?! First, no one knows who they are getting in the 1st Round. Second, no one knows how the board is going to fall. Third, no one knows if a player will get drafted very fast",1514627803282554884,omz007,29268678
I doubt they will like both especially at their spot. Kenyon Green makes sense cause he can play every position except Center(I bet with time he could). The 2nd pick is a no no with so many more important needs. Must be WR or TE Jelani Woods if needed. https://t.co/q3K6aiZlpA,1514076326583582727,omz007,29268678
"I like the number changes when they really have a meaning behind it like if itâ€™s the number they have worn throughout college. Seeing players back to their original number from college is really cool. KJ #1 looks great!

"Not signing this guy bugs me because he had no expectations &amp; then starting making catches,TDs &amp; making big runs like the WASH game. This shows me that they are going to get better WRs to fill the spots. Also shows faith in J.Washington who will be way better than expected. https://t.co/nh4X54I8se",1513967311664914435,omz007,29268678

Fans from every team used to give the proper respect to the Playoffs. They knew how hard it is to reach &amp; then have to win it w/ no 2nd chances. It takes 17 games to reach it. Stop acting like a QB is automatically reaching &amp; winning every single season. Be grateful &amp; enjoy the https://t.co/AEdfEBk0D8,1513949385448636421,omz007,29268678
