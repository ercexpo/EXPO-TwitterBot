"GGG with a big KO!! Forcing the trilogy... I still think he beat Canelo in the first fight, the 2nd fight Canelo beat him... so third fight is long overdue! At 40 years old, I think it will be very difficult for GGG to win but he is the only man that Canelo has never truly hurt! https://t.co/TK93ON8nH9",1512972226575876099,Deebo_99,35847791
"Hope Errol Spence takes this fight super seriously. Yordenis Ugas is a fighter hungry for legitimacy &amp; respect - a deadly combination. Too many people underestimating @YordenisUgas. Man can box &amp; his defense, counter-punching is solid. Going 2 be a great fight! #SpenceUgas",1512665028951953415,Deebo_99,35847791

"Someone just DMd me - ""Will Smith was just fighting for honor of his wife"" - OK but where was all this ""honor defending"" when other comedians were clowning them with ""August"" jokes? Didnt those jokes dishonor Jada? Would he have slapped Dave Chappelle or Kevin Hart? Doubt it.",1508470661102116874,Deebo_99,35847791
"More I think about it, more I think Will Smith played himself last night smacking Chris Rock. Why attack Chris? Will &amp; Jada have been mocked by late night tv hosts &amp; by so many others far worse &amp; more insulting. U think Will would have dared try to smack Joe Rogan? Doubt it.",1508442351492079619,Deebo_99,35847791
I think Will Smith just finally had enough of all the humiliation &amp; Jada jokes for the past couple of years &amp; exploded cause this was REAL - imagine if Chris Rock would have said the Jada's favorite month is August joke...wow.... watch the Japanese uncensored tape... https://t.co/eOi7wE7gaz,1508279184732393472,Deebo_99,35847791
"Great pick up for San Diego Padres! Makes that lineup really scary. Good luck to Luke Voit, a class act &amp; a great Yankee. Will miss the HRs &amp; the forearm bashes... https://t.co/2lBfSUm1uj",1504869430412644375,Deebo_99,35847791
"All I can do is SMDH... but I don't blame Marjorie Taylor Greene, she didn't just become stupid overnight, I blame the people who voted her into office just like you don't blame the monkey for shooting people, you blame the morons who gave the monkey the gun! https://t.co/FQdh6hQ1q1",1504616176659349512,Deebo_99,35847791
IKF is the type of player I have been talking about!! Appreciates what wearing those pinstripes mean. https://t.co/cwUFjN6oCV,1503941144765505538,Deebo_99,35847791
