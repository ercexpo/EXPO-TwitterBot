"""Walking Double-Double""
Bacot averaged 15.3 ppg and 16.5 rpg during NCAA Tournament. 
Think @innoutburger should give @iget_buckets35 a sweet NIL deal.
Possibly @StateFarm too
NIL allows players like Bacot to finish school and get rewarded financially while in school. https://t.co/aSacZqJ7Kj",1514306333138432005,TeamUSATracker,1018833763336380417

Nice win by Taylor Fritz.  Fritz missed some opportunities to take 1st  set but came back to win 2nd set in TB and from a break down in 3rd set to prevail over home-country WC Lucas Catarina.
