"For this exact reason, I'm wondering if Marvel hasn't started the Thor: Love &amp; Thunder campaign yet because the film's been pushed back to the 1st week of August. Just a thought... https://t.co/kohjSQ64Ot",1514772212103847936,CineFan2049,3418841716
"If WB ever wants to make a spiritual sequel to LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION, director Jeff Fowler should be at the top of their list. Especially in the first act of SONIC 2, Fowler nails the zany, slapstick tone that is typically only reserved for cartoons.",1514364131528388612,CineFan2049,3418841716
"AMBULANCE is this generation's SPEED. Unparalleled drone shots, riveting action, and surprisingly layered performances from Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jake Gyllenhaal &amp; Eliza González. A 2 hr cinematic shot of epinephrine that never slows downs. https://t.co/Xe7JAwKsPt",1514332373541863437,CineFan2049,3418841716

"Some parts haven't aged well, but KICK ASS is still a blast; like Spider-Man with the sensibilities of the JUMP STREET films. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the best ""Peter Parker"" since Tobey Maguire (sorry Tom Holland!), and the Sparks &amp; Elvis needle drops are exquisite. https://t.co/4UajuXJFHz",1513342541755785224,CineFan2049,3418841716
"I got a MoviePass card for my 15th birthday (years before it was $10 a month) and saw literally everything my multiplex had to offer that year, from BLENDED and MOMS NIGHT OUT to INTERSTELLAR and WHIPLASH. I learned then how film (when done right) could be art AND entertainment. https://t.co/AaUuDQcl0Y",1512247204353921027,CineFan2049,3418841716
Looking to watch a Nicolas Cage film in 30 mins to be ready for my #TheUnbearableWeightOfMassiveTalent rewatch in a couple weeks. Which should I pick? (All 1st time watches),1512241292868263936,CineFan2049,3418841716
"X takes far more risks but if we're talking pure enjoyment, it's SCREAM (2022) by a mile for me as it's my favorite horror franchise. https://t.co/4Sr1y1GoHb",1512205882037346307,CineFan2049,3418841716
