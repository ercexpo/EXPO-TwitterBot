I can definitely see the #Patriots trading out of the first round and acquiring some 2nd-4th round picks and draft a LOT of guys. This draft is very deep and loaded with talent. Wouldnâ€™t shock me if NE drafted 8-11 players.,1514824827982561281,NEPinsider,816447559283654656
#Patriots could definitely use a great athletic CB like McCollum https://t.co/VQouV4vZcr,1514759153956368386,NEPinsider,816447559283654656
