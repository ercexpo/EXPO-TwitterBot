With all due respect to Zorn (a very decent man) and Krieg (a super hard worker) imagine Steve Largent’s stats had he played with a HOF QB. He retired with virtually all the receiving records anyway but just imagine. I was fortunate to see every game he played. 80+ in person.,1514682852142563349,12thman1976,1879908710
In a surprising move the Denver Police Department is investigating Russell Wilson in the suspected arson at Mile High Stadium. In a statement earlier Wilson told the Denver media that he was “going to light this place up!”,1509986258793074691,12thman1976,1879908710
President Biden’s speech in Poland today included a message to the people of Russia. He told them that they are not at fault for the war in Ukraine and that Putin should be removed from power. These words from a U.S. president are profound and remarkable. A diplomatic Rubicon.,1507778553793843200,12thman1976,1879908710
The 8-1 SCOTUS vote on the release of 1/6 emails and docs becomes more clear in light of the fact that the abstaining vote came from Clarence Thomas whose wife sent emails in support of the insurrection. Thomas knew what his wife was up to and outrageously chose to help hide it.,1507485625598939140,12thman1976,1879908710
"SCJ Clarence Thomas needs to recuse himself from ruling on issues dealing with 1/6. He has already made rulings that bring ethical questions. If he fails to recuse in the future he should resign or be impeached.

Here’s an idea. Instead of just seizing the yachts of Russian oligarchs I think they should be emptied of fuel and towed to the open ocean for target practice by NATO forces. Film it all and put it on social media. Start with Putin’s yacht. #SinkRussianYachts,1506803635920924675,12thman1976,1879908710
Ukrainian wheat goes unplanted putting those who depend on it in real jeopardy of starvation. The Middle East survives on wheat from Ukraine and Russia. When shortages are realized in five to six months famine may kill more than the war itself. It’s a tragedy. #UkraineRussianWar,1506802331748212740,12thman1976,1879908710
The Malik Willis pro day showcased his live arm. He was very relaxed even though every NFL team had people in attendance. Pressure doesn’t seem to bother this young man and his 32 wondelic says he can easily master an NFL playbook. I’m hoping the Seahawks take him at number 9. https://t.co/GnzqdKK3TS,1506452673364594690,12thman1976,1879908710
The top spot in my draft wish list goes to Malik Willis. He had a great pro day and is rumored to be having dinner with Hawks QB coach Dave Canales. Willis is a high character kid with a great arm and a 32 wonderlic score. He could be the Seahawks QB1 for a decade. #MalikWillis,1506437980088532992,12thman1976,1879908710
