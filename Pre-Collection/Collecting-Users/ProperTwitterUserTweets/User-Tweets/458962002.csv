"We could’ve used them a bit more in the WS. But, they carried us there in the first place. IMO, if LMJ didn’t get hurt, we’d have won that series. Their lineup would’ve struggled with his particular mix IMO. https://t.co/xwkgk74wbw",1514655938745151494,BenOndaTop,458962002

"The Astros have the most spoiled fanbase in the sport over the last 5 going on 6 years. We’re 4-2. Quite easily COULD be 6-0. But, it is what it is. Win at this clip the rest of the year we should be the 1 seed. The bats don’t concern me.",1514457681024671744,BenOndaTop,458962002
