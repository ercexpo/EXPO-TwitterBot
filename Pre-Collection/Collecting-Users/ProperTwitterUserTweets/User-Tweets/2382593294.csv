"Another reason Little Big League gets my vote is all-time great manager/coach who gets fired inside the first 10 minutes of the movie, Dennis Farina. Did the same role a few years later in ""Eddie."" https://t.co/iUu9eXXe4Q",1514806279482478601,BrentStecker,2382593294
"Something going under the radar: #Mariners bullpen picking up where it left off. Sewald/Steckenrider look the same, Diego Castillo looks better, Andrés Muñoz was pure filth today, even Matt Festa is showing promise. Also wonder if Roenis Elías gets a shot as a second LHP soon.",1514782449527521286,BrentStecker,2382593294

"Great read from Brandon for you #Mariners fans. As usual, he has a great perspective on what the young M's arms are doing on the mound, and they were the most positive story of the opening road trip. https://t.co/0YrQhPetpc",1514739323005927448,BrentStecker,2382593294
Mitch Haniger is currently tied for second in MLB in homers after hitting his third of the season in the #Mariners' seventh game today. Toronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. leads the league with four after his three-homer game yesterday.,1514721343631097879,BrentStecker,2382593294
Already looking better. #Mariners can get back to even in the home opener tomorrow on @SEASports710. https://t.co/c8nJmcKL1y,1514713884535390230,BrentStecker,2382593294
I've been intrigued by this kid since the #Mariners drafted him in the second round in 2019. Strong academic background and history of winning at Arkansas. Interested to see how that pans out in the pros. https://t.co/AB8tvt4Wiu,1514712903684816897,BrentStecker,2382593294
MLB really knows how to build exciting new stars. Call 'em out on every two-strike pitch within three inches of the plate!,1514706229808959494,BrentStecker,2382593294
Apparently the outside of the plate is bigger for Julio Rodríguez than anybody else in the history of Major League Baseball.,1514705530865946664,BrentStecker,2382593294
