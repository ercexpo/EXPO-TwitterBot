"Where's the lie? 
You know it's true! 😂🤣 https://t.co/9hRZRaPqDS",1514778225917890565,t_vguy,1002716506415718401
"What is even going on here? 
This is crazy. I've never seen anything like this in my life. Expensive at $1500+ after tax &amp; shipping but the seller does have something here very rare &amp; very unique. 
Try looking at this on a Friday night after a few drinks lol 🍻 https://t.co/TI3Ghjsxm7",1514761777325649931,t_vguy,1002716506415718401

"This is the best footage I've ever seen of Ruth &amp; Gehrig taking BP. Utterly incredible. If someone colorized this professionally it would look like today, the quality is THAT good! Makes me wonder what it was filmed on.... awesome stuff! 🤩 https://t.co/HGcpSyi4BM",1514759700696379406,t_vguy,1002716506415718401
"Hobby question -
Has anyone come across 2022 Topps Series 1 yellow Walgreen's cards? The Meijer purple cards are out but I've not seen any Walgreen's parallels.

Hi @LakewoodPDCO. May I DM you please? I live in Lakewood &amp; have questions about something impacting me which I feel is likely illegal. Thank you.,1514706338240106526,t_vguy,1002716506415718401
"BIG vintage mail day 📬
Been picking up older 🏀 cards here &amp; there. The 1970 Topps Bart Starr is an upgrade. The stack of 1964 Topps Giant Baseball I made a killing on at just $1/ea basically, 40 of those. Big dent in completing the set. Spahn is an upgrade 😀 @CardPurchaser https://t.co/ky7Ckgze6t",1514684076996771846,t_vguy,1002716506415718401
"You are selling counterfeit slabs my dude. And then you're on here defending your actions for doing so? 
You just incriminated yourself. Good job 👏🏽 https://t.co/sRgabKh7yH",1514606419353370633,t_vguy,1002716506415718401
"I think I'm going to move the trading thread back to Monday evenings. There's so much stuff happening on hobby Twitter Wednesday night's that it's been a bit slow compared to Monday's. So that said, beginning next week it will be on Monday evenings again 👍🏼",1514425766947155969,t_vguy,1002716506415718401
