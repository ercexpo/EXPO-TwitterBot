#Deebo unfollowed the @49ers per #patmcafee. I’d love to see the #Packers trade for him. #iCanDream,1512111827991375878,johnnyphotogSTL,78773137
Amos is a super underrated and humble safety. Even as his accolades are being tweeted out he doesn’t point to himself but instead acknowledges how #blessed with talent he is. #GoPackGo https://t.co/Is9DYbj1fE,1511041042124095493,johnnyphotogSTL,78773137
Tried @PFF #mockdraft simulator and thought this idea of trading up (sacrificing a 2 and 3) could work out alright. #Packers https://t.co/8JORjjD4Du,1511040364404252682,johnnyphotogSTL,78773137
Salute to one of the best running backs of all time. I remember watching him blast through defenders nearly every time he touched the ball. #49ers #FrankGore #FutureHOF https://t.co/cmON6SmsHH,1510676989446926338,johnnyphotogSTL,78773137

This #nfl off season might be the wildest ever. Sit back and enjoy this season because I doubt we’ll see a shake up like this ever again.,1506676108548321289,johnnyphotogSTL,78773137

Started watching #Murderville. So far @ConanOBrien did a terrific job. @MoneyLynch has me dying in episode 2. Curious how the rest of the guests will do.,1506350990768934922,johnnyphotogSTL,78773137
