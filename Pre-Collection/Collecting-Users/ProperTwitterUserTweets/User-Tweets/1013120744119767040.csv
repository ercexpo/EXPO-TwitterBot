I like all the extra steps this goes through to make an alternative Qasali Pridemage. Its a really neat card that is definitely going to have a fanbase. https://t.co/MkM6J9HQdV,1514570813139263491,RedDeckTries,1013120744119767040
"Threatens that refund themselves somewhat are very cool. I wish the releases were reversed though, Employment would have made an excellent compliment to Gadrak in M21. https://t.co/Q3pV8Ds5t6",1514339084789239809,RedDeckTries,1013120744119767040
