My girl just drunk called me cus she got lost at Dodger stadium when her friend went to the bathroom and she had her phone. So she had me listen to the mariachis and talked my ear off about how it’s not safe for people to be playing catch with people everywhere 😭🤣 https://t.co/pOT3jbbqIl,1514774595743584260,birdboxinglife,870936914592800768
