"Bruce Brown grew up in Dorchester, and if he played on the Dorchester travel team, there's a very slim chance I played him back in like 2005

"I don’t put too much stock in what dudes say immediately following a big win. Still riding that adrenaline, emotions at their max - I’m not going to be giving Pat Bev’s comments much mind

If he’s still talking like he just won the Super Bowl *tomorrow*? Yeah I’ll clown on that",1514108890778112002,GeneralGrantW,1221321154654343168
"The Cavs are only down 9, imagine this game but the only difference is that you replace Lauri with Tatum. Maybe KD is just taking it easy but uhhhh... these Nets don't move me much thus far",1514047745094467586,GeneralGrantW,1221321154654343168

"Tatum is 24 years old and he’s been to the ECFs twice in his four seasons.
