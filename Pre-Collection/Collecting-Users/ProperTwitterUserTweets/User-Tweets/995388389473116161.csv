One of the best jokes in the show https://t.co/SPRrN687JY,1514844010434768899,CarlElmore4,995388389473116161
Yeah this sucked. Mads Mikkelson and Jude Law were good but this whole thing felt bloated and inconsequential. Last 30 minutes were somewhat interesting though. 4/10 https://t.co/eUdnbfa22J,1514831009585381379,CarlElmore4,995388389473116161

Moon Knight is good but Daredevil is 100% the superior show https://t.co/jSljZ6518J,1514272054182359042,CarlElmore4,995388389473116161
The new episode of #MoonKnight is definitely the weakest of the three so far but it isnâ€™t bad. I still enjoyed it for the most part with the character work and some of the visuals but the episodes action ranges from good to weak and there some contrivances that bothered me 6/10,1514247478920548357,CarlElmore4,995388389473116161
Piece of shit garbage movie. Everything besides the performances and score is awful. I consider this to have one of the worst screenplays ever written. Fuck this movie. 1/10 https://t.co/PIUo1RAFdE,1514045581240549386,CarlElmore4,995388389473116161
