Still canâ€™t believe Lakers didnâ€™t make playoffs. Westbrook really is a cancer,1509493941305065472,iamffrapper,904093622852653056
Another example how this generation SOFT. Everyone crying about the NFLâ€™s OT rules finally got their wish (at least for the playoffs). Bills defense couldnâ€™t stop the Chiefs from getting in the end zone on their first possession and you think they should get another chance ðŸ™„ ðŸ‘Ž,1508931445548539910,iamffrapper,904093622852653056
"Odell Beckham is open to a return with the Browns. Imagine him in the slot with DPJ and Cooper outside, David Njoku in the middle and Chubb. You can make an argument that this offense would have the potential to be one the best in the league. Donâ€™t sleep on Deshauan",1508594837754462213,iamffrapper,904093622852653056

"Never saw the hype around CEH. Devin Singletary was my comp from Day 1 short, slow and shifty https://t.co/abJ5eraul6",1507791103902240775,iamffrapper,904093622852653056
"For the 5th straight year thereâ€™s hype around Ronald Jones going into the season.

For the 5th straight season you will be disappointed except for the one game he goes off on your bench

Sorry Iâ€™m a little rusty since my 2 month brief retirement haha https://t.co/7v48qvJJSY",1507402295541215239,iamffrapper,904093622852653056
Iâ€™m wondering how long itâ€™s gonna take before we see a JuJu and Austin Mahomes collab on TikTok,1507397207783264259,iamffrapper,904093622852653056
Everyone doubting Pat Mahomes is gonna look silly and Iâ€™m thankful cuz I get to finally draft him. Big players do big things. A lot of people donâ€™t know this but Aaron Rodgers put up better numbers without DaVante Adams in the lineup.,1507386309568049155,iamffrapper,904093622852653056
