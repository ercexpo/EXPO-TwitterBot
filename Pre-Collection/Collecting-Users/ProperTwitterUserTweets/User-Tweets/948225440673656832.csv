"I don’t understand what the Bradley Beal infatuation is, I really don’t. A great individual scorer who has a cap on team success. Wanting to keep him solely because he’s their safest chance at having talent on the roster seems ass backwards to me.",1514628976978845703,jack_skolnik,948225440673656832
I’m taking my chances building a contender over being blatantly average because our top player is the safest option for having talent on the roster. https://t.co/OSi670DEZ2,1514616381488058372,jack_skolnik,948225440673656832
