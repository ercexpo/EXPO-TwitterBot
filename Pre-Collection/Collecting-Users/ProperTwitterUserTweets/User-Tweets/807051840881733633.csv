Thank goodness the Caps didnâ€™t let a defensive liability like McMichael ruin the game tonight ðŸ™„,1514781628177911811,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
119 pages of Ravens specific draft guidance!?!?! Yes please!ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ https://t.co/T2TnnDk1Zs,1514778050675707906,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
"Sammy was faaar from the Ravens biggest problem last year, but this moment will always stick in my mind as the point in time where things started to unravel for the 2021 Ravens https://t.co/wj12gPDxOb",1514686937994444820,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
"Outside of the question on guarantees, I donâ€™t think this contract really changes anything for Lamar. Weâ€™re looong past the point where we knew Lamar was going to get north of $40M per year, and Carr was never a reasonable comp player. Market remains the same imo #RavensFlock https://t.co/YofWg9bSFN",1514270694107860998,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
"Whether or not this is fully guaranteed will have huge ramifications going forward. If it is, then thatâ€™s going to be the new standard for QB contracts https://t.co/zPTIAlgNcK",1514250829246578689,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
"Bynes was a no brainer to bring back once Wagner went to LA. Heâ€™s saved our ILB group midseason in two of the last the last three years, why not just have him on to begin with! https://t.co/6S8adIwbBo",1512557498225496067,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
"Unless they got bad news on the injury recovery front, Iâ€™d much rather the Ravens wait until after the draft for a move like this. Wait to see whether you end up with a chance to draft a guy who could contribute right away. Gordon isnâ€™t a game changer at this stage https://t.co/wGcgt8q8R9",1512438750483124227,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
"When I first saw them linked to Mathieu again, I thought it was mostly a funny idea. I've kinda talked myself into it now.

It would be a TON of $ to be throwing at the secondary. But if you pair it with  Edge + IDL + CB in the first 5 picks, could be a fun defense https://t.co/cryZ1piket",1509745641697648641,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
"Oh heck yeah, do it and then go base dime defense lol

Canâ€™t have a front 7 problem if you never play a front 7 ðŸ¤£ https://t.co/RNo40FUaTn",1509709484985266181,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
"Not a ton of names still out there that really interest me. Ravens may just add a couple depth pieces and carry the space past the draft

Williams/Moses is a better haul than I expected, and this offseasonâ€™s success was always going to live or die on the draft picks #RavensFlock",1509628750559952908,zweinberg18,807051840881733633
