So happy for Alia and Ranbir. They look so good together. ðŸ™Œ,1514680370020687885,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
H Pandya at captain and Buttler in team was massive today. I think I went above 100+ spots to 62nd overall. Only takes a couple good performances and you are set.,1514670977694810112,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
RR really brought in Neesham in place of an injured Boult. What a downgrade lmao.,1514605524678938644,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
MI are 0-5 ðŸ˜­. I am loving this. That's what you get when your batting ends at no 6. Maybe actually use that fourth overseas option on Tim David or Fabian Allen for once. #IPL2022 #MIvsPBKS,1514301978121285636,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
"RIP to that one person who has Livingstone, Kishan and Chahar in their fantasy team. I have the first two and almost made the move this game week to get Chahar in but backed out last moment.",1514285178344165382,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
MI have lost their mind. Brevis and Tilak over SKY. They deserve to lose. #IPL2022 #MIvsPBKS,1514280018897211397,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
"Saba Qamar, Nauman Ijaz and the entire crew have done a splendid job in Mrs and Mr Shameem. Yes, it could have been shorter especially in the latter half, but I would still recommend this to everyone just for the acting display and the topics that were dealt with so beautifully.",1513967774816776197,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
"DK well played. Incredible knock, has been on fire this season, but if we were ever going to chase this then we we needed a good start from at least one of the top 3. #IPL2022 #rcb #RCBvCSK",1513936520515829761,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
"At least RCB are considerate of their fans. They don't waste time like SRH or other teams, if they are gonna lose they lose in their first five overs. RIP NRR, like always. #IPL2022 #rcb #CSKvsRCB",1513919284480823304,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
The pain is immense. ðŸ˜­ https://t.co/E7SIpsYGE6,1513918522874859536,PatelRikken,1027674074317815809
