"Some interesting Mavs #s:
-#8 in 3PA and #10 in 3P, but only #19 with 35%. Dinwiddie and DFS -40%, Brunson-37%. Bertans-36% with DAL
-DAL is pretty low in PPG (#24), FG (#24), FGA (#27), FTM and FTA (#22). Slowest pace in NBA.
-#24 in RPG. Best non-Luka rebounder is Kleber (5.9)",1514992696397549576,davidjsmith1232,25782605
