"Shame on the supporters selling their tickets and giving up on this team. Allowing shit like that to happen, at home. Shameful. An embarrassment to the club and sport.
Never show your face in the camp nou again. Ever.",1514723284016943112,jake_siegman10,3887679017
"Aubameyang missing those 2, a clear and obvious handball not being called because VAR just ""wasnt working"" and constantly dealing with this refs aids. 
Won't matter. Glad we can exit out and not worry about it anymore. Stuff has to happen. Signings have to happen.

"Knew this is how the 2nd leg would turn out for us after the first leg.
Embarrassing. 
Whatever. Take this as a lesson. 
Passion flew out the window in this one. 
Whatever. Obviously still so much to get right. We will get there.",1514705051624869893,jake_siegman10,3887679017
"You can't tell me this ref isn't on drugs. 
What a joke man.",1514704180954517515,jake_siegman10,3887679017
Momentum went out the door the second the ref decided to spend half an hour on something that could've been done in 3 minutes,1514702333195788296,jake_siegman10,3887679017
"What an absolute joke. A 9th position team in the Bundesliga beating a team that thrashed Real and Atletico 4-0, and 4-2.
Not happy at all.
Always these games that come to haunt us. Every time.",1514701719011221511,jake_siegman10,3887679017
