The #Braves offense has had more hard-hit balls than their opponent in every game but one this season. In 5-of-7 games they've had double-digit hard-hit balls. Do not spend too much time worrying about this offense.,1514442029836779524,ShortStopBall,562962878
"Max Fried's exit velocity against through two starts is 83.6 MPH, which would be slightly above his career-best of 83.4 MPH, and would put him in the top 10% of the league. Yea, he hasn't been sharp, but dude has been super unlucky to start. #Braves",1514432340772143114,ShortStopBall,562962878
"That bottom of the fourth was it for me in that game for #Braves. Ozzie gets walk after great AB. Olson hits a ball 104 right at 2B for easy DP. Riley BBs, Ozuna lines out. So close to being a big inning, yet they got nothing.",1514324863221211143,ShortStopBall,562962878
Do we need Rosario to be put on the IL until September? Is that how it works?,1514299746537590787,ShortStopBall,562962878
2 walks and 2 balls bit 104-plus MPH somehow leads to no runs for the #Braves in that inning. Apparently they used all their luck last night.,1514296210001121288,ShortStopBall,562962878
"Not sure what Ozzie was thinking there, but that was brutal. Trying to answer back, get a leadoff single, and then get caught stealing...",1514282451899662341,ShortStopBall,562962878
And he just did the second greatest thing by getting thrown out at home to mercifully end that inning. https://t.co/jNUb12LHxl,1514072171332739078,ShortStopBall,562962878
"Of course, the only ball of the game Marcell Ozuna doesn't hit 95 MPH or harder comes off a position player.",1514071104268218371,ShortStopBall,562962878
Patrick Corbin's last 7 starts against the #Braves: 0-7 with a 7.25 ERA.,1514068171451514881,ShortStopBall,562962878
Jackson Stephens out here fooling hitters by throwing 93 MPH fastballs right down the middle. You love to see it.,1514064046533787653,ShortStopBall,562962878
