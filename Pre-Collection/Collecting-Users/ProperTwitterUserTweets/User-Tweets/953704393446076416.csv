"The #49ers officially signed Kemoko Turay. 

I Love that they're adding pass rushing depth. Turay can replicate Arden Key's production that we saw towards the end of last season. 

Solid signing.",1514648296576327697,NinerNick_22,953704393446076416
"For what they charge, Chipotle is the most chintzy fast food place ever.

We talkin' rice. Not even meat. That's a whole other story.",1514323387400671232,NinerNick_22,953704393446076416
