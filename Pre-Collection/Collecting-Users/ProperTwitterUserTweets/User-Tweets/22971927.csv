"Question for the Knicks, why didn’t you start IQ and OBI 8 weeks ago? I’d like someone to give me a good answer.",1513330674316455937,oldveteran,22971927
Judge just turned down an 8 year 233 million dollar contract with the Yankees. Bad move. I thought he wanted to be a Yankee forever!,1512814298162106370,oldveteran,22971927
The New York Rangers just had a great weekend beating 2 first place teams back to back. Keep it up guys!,1505711126096461824,oldveteran,22971927
The Yankees year will depend on injuries. If healthy they can be competitive but if the injuries pile up they are looking at 4th in their division. Yankee fans keep your fingers crossed and 🙏,1505598250425847808,oldveteran,22971927

Rizzo coming back to Yankees. Good move. He’s going to make Torres look like a respectable infielder. Now get Judge vaccinated,1503949415978975235,oldveteran,22971927

Suggestion for the Knicks. Cancel rest of the season and give us all time to recover from last night. Pathetic,1494422640173350912,oldveteran,22971927
