"The only reason I would have watched #WrestleMania would have been to watch @TrueKofi and @AustinCreedWins get a big win (or at least a big match), but in the end I figured @WWE would ruin it somehow. Sadly...I was right.  They cut the whole damn match. What a show of disrespect.",1510467943561404424,Michael_Hagins,207349024
I want to thank @UPS for making the death of our cat an even more unbearable experience.  Their inability to deliver us the ashes in an urn have driven me and my partner so mad.  In the future we will AVOID having #UPS deliver ANYTHING to us.  I hope they go out of business soon.,1506296013660856324,Michael_Hagins,207349024
"DeShaun Watson: Where should I play?

Tom Brady: You don't want to play in the NFC South.

DeShaun Watson: I don't?

Tom Brady: No.

DeShaun Watson:...

Tom Brady:...

Tom Brady:...

DeShaun Watson: I want to play for Cleveland!

Tom Brady: ...there you go.",1505152849935847425,Michael_Hagins,207349024
"So...Tom Brady comes to the @Buccaneers, recommends some friends and promptly wins the Super Bowl. Then...the next year they bring back the same people to reload and they fall short due to injury. This year it's more bring back the best starters AND reload with some new blood...",1504874008831004710,Michael_Hagins,207349024

"Fun how @MadDogUnleashed is so tired of @TomBrady. One thing @Buccaneers fans never get tired of is winning.  After years of bad QB play, bad luck and hopeless seasons, us Buccaneers fans will let him play until he's 50 if he wanted to. @gregauman knows what I'm talking about!",1504250189019815940,Michael_Hagins,207349024
I have always loved The New Day.  I watched @TrueKofi and @AustinCreedWins and @WWEBigE and loved everything they did and reveled in the championships they won.  And I'm so hoping to see Big E come back stronger than ever. I hate #WWE but my love for the New Day will never end!,1502995773897773064,Michael_Hagins,207349024
The Castaway memes are on point for the Russell Wilson trade.  Sadly I can only expect @FO_VVerhei and many Seahawks fans will be in a foul mood for the next few days.,1501366040772714501,Michael_Hagins,207349024
"I'm done, #WWE fans.  @AEW is light years better than the bullshit you've been served by @VinceMcMahon and the @WWE roster.  If you love it, good for you.  But I stopped watching in 2019 and haven't looked back, and I am so much happier for it.  I hope other wrestlers can escape.",1500685343259041793,Michael_Hagins,207349024
#WWE fans are so interesting. They're on Twitter saying Austin Theory is a star because he got squashed by Brock Lesnar in a title match at Madison Square Garden. I've seen guys become stars after a hard fought loss. Has ANYONE become a star because they got destroyed and lost?,1500538980105863171,Michael_Hagins,207349024
