2021 Knicks 41-31 (0-3 vs Nets)

2022 Nets 44-38
2022 Knicks 37-45 (0-4 vs Nets)

Combined records with head to head games flipped

Knicks 85-69
Nets 85-69",1513747001598365700,Zy706,41431761
The Sacramento Kings have missed the playoffs for the 16th straight year. This is also their 16th straight losing season. Both of those are the longest streaks in NBA or NHL history,1513302637424353289,Zy706,41431761
