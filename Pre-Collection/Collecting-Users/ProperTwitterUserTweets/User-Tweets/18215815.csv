""Cancel it,"" I say. No, can't cancel until it's shipped.
Now I'm told I can't cancel, b/c it's already shipped.
WTF?",1514702277029814277,word_czar,18215815

"Hey, @Dell. You LIED to me. 

You said my laptop would arrive today.  It hasn't even left Asia yet, I was just told. 

Do you LIE to all your customers?
