Hearing Deshaun Watson lie to the City of Cleveland and the United States makes me want to vomit. I'm glad Joe Burrow is my quarterback,1507418098638495744,Whodey_daily,849088276002635777
Dolphins overpaid....he's a great player but im not guaranteeing 48 million with that injury history,1506421985450110980,Whodey_daily,849088276002635777
"The Browns literally sold their soul. They ensured they won't be competitive for a very long time. And if this Deshaun Watson stuff blows up in their face, which it will, they still don't have a 1st round pick until 2025. 2025 people 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  #trash",1506035341941264394,Whodey_daily,849088276002635777

Browns fans who put Watson above Burrow and Jackson have no idea how the game of football is played. Whatsoever. #trash,1505890687232921604,Whodey_daily,849088276002635777

I remember over 15 years of ragging on this front office. Even after playoff appearances. I remember like 2 years ago people were calling Duke a fraud and saying he should be fired. Obviously Joey B plays a big part of this but I honestly believe Zac Taylor does to. In a big way,1505757796557627396,Whodey_daily,849088276002635777
