"I don’t know if I’ll ever live down being in the stadium to see Clayton Kershaw throw 7 innings of a perfect game only for him to be pulled

Maybe it’s the right decision for the team, but man am I upset I missed the opportunity to witness history https://t.co/QL093A9PYY",1514373408984809482,the_Son_of_Car,977348327183409152

At 80 pitches
