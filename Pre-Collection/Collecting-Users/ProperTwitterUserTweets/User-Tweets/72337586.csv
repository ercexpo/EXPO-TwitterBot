I just backed Frankenstein the Unconquered #1: An Action-Horror Comic on @Kickstarter https://t.co/VTu6eu7blD,1514448320801947650,AJDoesItAll,72337586
Thank you to whoever's #Fortnite handle is BobDaboleena. It made me and Zach laugh xD,1514441213109317635,AJDoesItAll,72337586
Well I won't say no to that :P plus gives me the next shoutout for my next vid :P https://t.co/qNv6VShDKn,1514333262797283341,AJDoesItAll,72337586
But it's why I don't just back Kickstarters. It's why my main pulls have been from the indie scene in general. I've praised @AfterShockComix @blackmaskstudio and @thevaultcomics a LOT for good reasons for it: they are massively amazing! We're in an indie renaissance and I love it https://t.co/Mp0y6KMrPr,1514320953131642881,AJDoesItAll,72337586
"""Why do you back Kickstarters?"" Because the indie comic scene has and will always be important. When they're good they're the best! like @PatShand's Destiny NY or @ComicUno and @PhilFalcoWrites's Bivisibility or @LONGEXP0SURE or @GiseleLagace' Menage a 3 or @wifwulf!",1514319593447243788,AJDoesItAll,72337586
