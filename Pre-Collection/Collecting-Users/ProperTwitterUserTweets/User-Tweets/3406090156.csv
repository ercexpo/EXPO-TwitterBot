"Kudos to @sporer who is kicking my butt this week in @ToutWars HTH. He has the week's HS.

Michael Lorenzen was a great RP eligible SP in the format, that Paul took full advantage of.

I have a few more starts than Paul this weekend, but this week will be an uphill battle for me. https://t.co/J96i0ezZGK",1514754730995630084,ATCNY,3406090156
"Per game, Cooper is an excellent fantasy asset even in moderate depth mixed leagues (&gt;12 team).

Problem is he always gets hurt.

But in the short term, very useable in fantasy. https://t.co/TByZlnyxCb",1514753918072410112,ATCNY,3406090156
"If you bet the under on prospects in the near term upon first call-up, you'll usually be correct.

You sometimes get a Soto or a Tatis. But those are the exceptions, not the rule.

Vlad took a few years to get going. Trout took his 2nd year ... etc. https://t.co/8Y6NLQUsl6",1514753203715334150,ATCNY,3406090156
"Steven Kwan is not peak Michael Brantley. It was a great week.

He's Luis Arraez but batting 2nd not 9th.

Half a dozen steals, maybe 8 homers and a ~.295 BA. A decent number of runs for batting in the 2 hole.

Temper expectations.",1514730111051960331,ATCNY,3406090156
