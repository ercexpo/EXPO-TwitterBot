"Someone is lobbing rocks at cars in the area of Red Bridge &amp; Holmes, down to Blue Ridge.

This information comes from a Nextdoor post where multiple people have reported attacks.

I was myself attacked Tuesday night as I approached Blue Ridge.

Be careful driving in this area. https://t.co/dEuCvb9K91",1514609456436310034,ClayWendler,61897184
