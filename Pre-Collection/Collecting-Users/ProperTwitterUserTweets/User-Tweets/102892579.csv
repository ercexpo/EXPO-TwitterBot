"Creatively, a series of Vertigo Comics - like horror films is a place I'd love to see WB/DC go.  

For one thing it's an area no one is really working in so they wouldn't be playing the constant game of catch - up they are with superheroes.

But as I say, that is a vain hope.",1514685732744413223,Varkentine,102892579
"This.  Mother of God.

And I don't know about you, but I am noticing which tweets, etc use the words ""IN BACK OF HEAD WHILE LAYING ON TOP OF"" ...and which do not. https://t.co/ucGuODtq0Z",1514445541840543746,Varkentine,102892579
"As I might have mentioned a few times, I think Mayim Bialik is arguably a bonkers anti-vaxxer; inarguably a snake-oil saleslady.  

But supposedly what really bothers Jeopardy viewers is ads for a new Kardashian TV series.

Why do I bother?",1514403708938858496,Varkentine,102892579

"I came of political age, so to speak, in the cold war but I have never felt more ""There is a bear in the woods/evil empire"" about Russia than I do these days.
