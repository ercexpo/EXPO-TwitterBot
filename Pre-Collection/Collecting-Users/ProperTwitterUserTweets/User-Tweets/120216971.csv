Great overview. Completely agree. I wish I could get over this but as each day of this new season goes by it’s bothering me more. #FIA #AbuDhabiGP #LH44 #f1 https://t.co/z5tHDweiKG,1508791896012992515,victormazzeo,120216971

I snuck out of my bedroom at 12:30am after everyone was asleep and quietly clicked on our Zenith tube TV to catch this sweaty dude live on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. It was 1977. It was this video. And it changed music for me. #RIPmeatloaf  https://t.co/VK0ZV9wBHk,1484566297207791621,victormazzeo,120216971
