"They did it!! They did it for Foley!!🎉🎉🎉 The feels😭❤️ 

The GOAT forever. How lucky were we to witness the greatness of Pat Foley?! Won’t be the same without him. His voice will forever be “home”, as Eddie says.😭💪  Thank you for everything! #Blackhawks #Legend https://t.co/WjW3oHJT2t",1514811439352979468,brooke_lofo,417437506
"Idk what “hockey” the #Blackhawks and #SJSharks are attempting, but this is bad😂

It’s okay though, bc that means more time for Pat and Eddie to tell amazing stories because the game is giving them nothing to call.🙈",1514786409025990659,brooke_lofo,417437506
"All I want to see is the #Blackhawks  retrieve a dump-in, score a goal with “tree-tirty tree left in the tird”, and for them to win so we can hear “HAWKS WIN” one last time all in honor of Pat Foley. Is that too much to ask for tonight?!😭❤️ #FoleysFarewell",1514751917813125121,brooke_lofo,417437506

"New ‘Blackhawks Banter’ out now!⬇️🎉 We debated all of the lineup changes and losses that came this past week!

Should Reichel get an extended stay? What do you think of the new lines?🤔 #THW #Blackhawks #NHL #HockeyTwitter https://t.co/wHK78ojQBe",1513987755600224259,brooke_lofo,417437506
