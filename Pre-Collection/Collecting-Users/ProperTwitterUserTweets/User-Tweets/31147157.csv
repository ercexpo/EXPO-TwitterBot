"Nice review by @Zach_Hablinski. 

My quick thought…The jersey looks like an 80’s Tron virtual world theme. I would’ve went more late 60’s space theme, an era that made Houston synonymous with space. The logo on the hats and hoodies hit the mark though.

"I know people like the jerseys. I’m not hating…the overall design just isn’t for me. I love this logo though. Definitely investing in the hoodie and the hat.

"Great insight from @astronomic1 on the rotation’s performance against the Angels.

Framber is a star, Verlander is mostly back and Odorizzi even threw strikes. Very encouraging. Its going to be quite the show once these guys get stretched out.

"Well, one thing is certain…Astros have no shortage of right handed hitters to face off with Suarez and the Angels today. 

Let’s close out this series with a W!

"Justin Verlander returns to action with a nice 1-2-3 inning. Two strikes and a long fly out. Looking good!

"Chill. Yuli Gurriel was placed on the paternity list.
