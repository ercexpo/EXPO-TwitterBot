Cam Smith is having a tough day. I wonder if the emotional ride of Augusta is hanging over his head. #pgatour #RBCHeritage,1514673788222423056,panderson1988,49503473
The Will Meyers pitching experiment isnâ€™t going well. #mlb #Padres,1514104281909112834,panderson1988,49503473
"&gt;Time heals all wounds in regards to Mike Matheny

Nope. He can come back to hang out, but I don't want him involved in the front office or management again. #STLCards",1514052616036270084,panderson1988,49503473
I imagine this @BigRandyNLU when he sees Scottie four putt to win. Lol https://t.co/nTUVlmrWJ6,1513290963816488964,panderson1988,49503473
Augusta has banned people for life over a cell phone. Maybe they should do that to Faldo besides the annual dinner after today.,1513285240638230528,panderson1988,49503473
They should just move Nick Faldo out and use Ian Baker Finch as the main analyst.,1513275326083878914,panderson1988,49503473
"RORY GOING BALLS OUT TO END HIS ROUND! He shot a 64! If only he had one other good round, and he could be tied or leading #themasters!",1513272929794113536,panderson1988,49503473
"Welp, Cam Smith is sadly done now. Unless Scottie collapses opening a back door for Rory, then he will win #themasters. Good for him, but I always wish for a tight leaderboard into the final 2-3 holes over someone running away with it with 8 holes remaining.",1513269642600583175,panderson1988,49503473
Rory seems to play better when the main cameras aren't showing him. lol #themasters,1513266482842587146,panderson1988,49503473
I would love to see this round for Rory to be his reawakening where he starts going on a tear again after #themasters like he did a decade ago. Imagine him coming in hot for the PGA Championship or US Open later this year.,1513257906082557952,panderson1988,49503473
