"The #Cardinals play in one hour. Time to fire up the grill, take the brats out of the refrigerator, put the jersey on, and open a cold beer. #Rituals",1512837492126494728,tiguts,160061351
Baseball man. What is better than baseball. Find raw emotions like this for a game out of 162. God I love this sport. https://t.co/Se1kmedRx9,1512608383374925824,tiguts,160061351
That Stanton swing was worse than the drunkest guy in the party attempting a Dizzy Bat. Jesus. https://t.co/uFfKHlacJA https://t.co/q2NUzQdZeW,1512528855701069827,tiguts,160061351
Rizzo has always been the toughest guy for me to root against during his time with the #Cubs. Dude is a stud and so likeable. He made the #Cardinals pay far too often with those RF pools. Glad he's in the Bronx now and out of the National League. Nightmare matchup guy. https://t.co/TTXMTz5LXP,1512485486085955587,tiguts,160061351
"The #STLCards may go 162-0 this year. What a performance. 9-0 to kick-off the year, perfect day in St Louis.

TON with 5 RBIs. 
Goldy reaching in all 5 PAs.
Waino 6-inning shutout.
Tommy HR. Nolan HR.
Yadi with a CS DP.

What. A. Day. We are back, baby!",1512212833924263958,tiguts,160061351
