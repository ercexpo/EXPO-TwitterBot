"BTW, it was obvious last month that KirILoff was not ready because he was favoring his wrist, and was rubbing it, shaking it, etc. The #MNTwins media were either blind or did not want to report that. https://t.co/XjRu3fPkGy",1514760080608186369,thrylos98,51308974
"Memo to the local #MNTwins ""press"": If you think and write that KirILoff with his career 88 OPS+ is better than Sano with his career 118 OPS+ some of us might think that this opinion is motivated by racism, religion or other nasty stuff.  Look. At. The. Facts.",1514759037350514688,thrylos98,51308974
"#MNTwins game 1 haiku:
Opening day hope
Please don't flip that bat too soon
Hungry like the wolf",1512603685091786755,thrylos98,51308974
"The #MNTwins trade a former closer for another who is younger with +1 year of club control, and a 27 y.o 4th OF/DH for a 26 y.o mid rotation + starter with 3 years of club control left and save ~$3.5M in the process. What's not to like?",1512072994146848787,thrylos98,51308974
"I just don't get this obsession with Rogers. He was a failed starter turned into a decent but not elite reliever. If the #MNTwins get a starter with 3+ years of control for him, Duran, Duffey, heck even Archer can close for them",1511867823139823629,thrylos98,51308974
#MNTwins IF Luis Arraez having PAs with the Fort Myers team.  Alex Kirilloff is in the next field with Cedar Rapids https://t.co/f6YDKCYw95,1506686604752171012,thrylos98,51308974
35 starts between Duffy and Vargas is not spot starting. https://t.co/m13jvqBUYr,1506411498280833024,thrylos98,51308974
Since the 1994 strike only one MLB team (2004 Red Sox) won the world series without having at least one lefty starter.  The #MNTwins really lack on that department.,1506398110116896768,thrylos98,51308974
Carlos Correa and Luis Arraez infield practice #MNTwins https://t.co/cJy87m5pr2,1506296494512648195,thrylos98,51308974
